<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>I have gathered into this volume several short fictions of the
type I have already found it convenient to refer to as
&ldquo;international&rdquo;&mdash;though I freely recognise,
before the array of my productions, of whatever length and
whatever brevity, the general applicability of that term.&nbsp;
On the interest of <i>contrasted</i> things any painter of life
and manners inevitably much depends, and contrast, fortunately
for him, is easy to seek and to recognise; the only difficulty is
in presenting it again with effect, in extracting from it its
sense and its lesson.&nbsp; The reader of these volumes will
certainly see it offered in no form so frequent or so salient as
that of the opposition of aspects from country to country.&nbsp;
Their author, I am quite aware, would seem struck with no
possibility of contrast in the human lot so great as that
encountered as we turn back and forth between the distinctively
American and the distinctively European outlook.&nbsp; He might
even perhaps on such a showing be represented as scarce aware,
before the human scene, of any other sharp antithesis at
all.&nbsp; He is far from denying that this one has always been
vivid for him; yet there are cases in which, however obvious and
however contributive, its office for the particular demonstration
has been quite secondary, and in which the work is by no means
merely addressed to the illustration of it.&nbsp; These things
have <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>had
in the latter case their proper subject: as, for instance, the
subject of &ldquo;The Wings of the Dove,&rdquo; or that of
&ldquo;The Golden Bowl,&rdquo; has not been the exhibited
behaviour of certain Americans as Americans, of certain English
persons as English, of certain Romans as Romans.&nbsp; Americans,
Englishmen, Romans are, in the whole matter, agents or victims;
but this is in virtue of an association nowadays so developed, so
easily to be taken for granted, as to have created a new scale of
relations altogether, a state of things from which
<i>emphasised</i> internationalism has either quite dropped or is
well on its way to drop.&nbsp; The dramatic side of human
situations subsists of course on contrast; and when we come to
the two novels I have just named we shall see, for example, just
how they positively provide themselves with that source of
interest.&nbsp; We shall see nevertheless at the same time that
the subject could in each case have been perfectly expressed had
<i>all</i> the persons concerned been only American or only
English or only Roman or whatever.</p>
<p>If it be asked then, in this light, why they deviate from that
natural harmony, why the author resorts to the greater
extravagance when the less would serve, the answer is simply that
the course taken has been, on reflexion, the course of the
greater amusement.&nbsp; That is an explanation adequate, I
admit, only when itself a little explained&mdash;but I shall have
due occasion to explain it.&nbsp; Let me for the moment merely
note that the very condition I here glance at&mdash;that of the
achieved social fusion, say, without the sense and experience of
which neither &ldquo;The Wings of the Dove,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;The
Golden Bowl,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;The Portrait of a Lady,&rdquo; nor
even, after all, I think, &ldquo;The Ambassadors,&rdquo; would
have been written&mdash;represents a series of facts of the
highest interest and one that, at this time of day, the
late-coming <a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>observer and painter, the novelist sometimes depressed
by all the drawbacks of a literary form overworked and relaxed,
can only rejoice to meet in his path and to measure more and more
as a portent and an opportunity.&nbsp; In proportion as he
intelligently meets it, and more especially in proportion as he
may happen to have &ldquo;assisted&rdquo; from far back at so
many of the odd and fresh phenomena involved, must he see a vast
new province, infinitely peopled and infinitely elastic&mdash;by
which I mean with incalculable power to grow&mdash;annexed to the
kingdom of the dramatist.&nbsp; On this point, however, much more
is to be said than I can touch on by the way&mdash;so that I
return to my minor contention; which is that in a whole group of
tales I here collect the principle of illustration has on the
other hand quite definitely been that the idea could <i>not</i>
have expressed itself without the narrower application of
international terms.&nbsp; The contrast in &ldquo;Lady
Barbarina&rdquo; depends altogether on the immitigable Anglicism
of this young woman and that equally marked projection of New
York elements and objects which, surrounding and framing her
figure, throws it into eminent relief.&nbsp; She has her personal
qualities, but the very interest, the very curiosity of the
matter is that her imbroglio is able to attest itself with scarce
so much as a reference to them.&nbsp; It plays itself out quite
consistently on the plane of her general, her instinctive, her
exasperatedly conscious ones.&nbsp; The others, the more
intimate, the subtler, the finer&mdash;so far as there may have
been such&mdash;virtually become, while the story is enacted, not
relevant, though their relevancy might have come up on some other
basis.</p>
<p>But that this is true, always in its degree, of each of the
other contributions to the class before us, we shall sufficiently
make out, I think, as we take them in their order.&nbsp; I am
only struck, I may indeed <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>parenthesise, with the inveteracy
of the general ground (not to say of the extension I give it)
over which my present remarks play.&nbsp; It does thus in truth
come home to me that, combining and comparing in whatever
proportions and by whatever lights, my &ldquo;America&rdquo; and
its products would doubtless, as a theme, have betrayed gaps and
infirmities enough without such a kicking-up of the dramatic dust
(mainly in the foreground) as I could set my &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;
in motion for; just as my Europe would probably have limped
across our stage to no great effect of processional state without
an ingenuous young America (constantly seen as ingenuous and
young) to hold up its legendary train.&nbsp; At the same time I
pretend not at all to regret my having had from the very first to
see my workable world all and only as an unnatural mixture.&nbsp;
No mixture, for that matter, is quite unnatural unless quite
sterile, and the particular range of associations that betimes,
to my eyes, blocked out everything else, blocked out aspects and
combinations more simply conditioned, was at least not open to
the reproach of not giving me results.&nbsp; These were but what
they could be, of course; but such as they were, at all events,
here am I at this time of day quite earnestly grouping,
distinguishing, discussing them.&nbsp; The great truth in the
whole connexion, however, is, I think, that one never really
chooses one&rsquo;s general range of vision&mdash;the experience
from which ideas and themes and suggestions spring: this proves
ever what it has had to be, this is one with the very turn
one&rsquo;s life has taken; so that whenever it
&ldquo;gives,&rdquo; whatever it makes us feel and think of, we
regard very much as imposed and inevitable.&nbsp; The subject
thus pressed upon the artist is the necessity of his case and the
fruit of his consciousness; which truth makes and has ever made
of any quarrel with his subject, and <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>stupid attempt to go behind
<i>that</i>, the true stultification of criticism.&nbsp; The
author of these remarks has in any case felt it, from far back,
quite his least stupid course to meet halfway, as it were, the
turn taken and the perceptions engendered by the tenor of his
days.&nbsp; Here it is that he has never pretended to &ldquo;go
behind&rdquo;&mdash;which would have been for him a deplorable
waste of time.&nbsp; The thing of profit is to have your
experience&mdash;to recognise and understand it, and for this
almost any will do; there being surely no absolute ideal about it
beyond getting from it all it has to give.&nbsp; The
artist&mdash;for it is of this strange brood we speak&mdash;has
but to have his honest sense of life to find it fed at every pore
even as the birds of the air are fed; with more and more to give,
in turn, as a consequence, and, quite by the same law that
governs the responsive affection of a kindly-used animal, in
proportion as more and more is confidently asked.</p>
<p>All of which, however, doubtless wanders a little far from my
mild argument&mdash;that of my so grateful and above all so
well-advised primary acceptance of a <i>determined</i> array of
appearances.&nbsp; What I was clearly to be treated to by
fate&mdash;with the early-taken ply I have already elsewhere
glanced at&mdash;was (should I have the intelligence to embrace
it) some considerable occasion to appreciate the mixture of
manners.&nbsp; So, as I say, there would be a decent economy in
cultivating the intelligence; through the sincerity of which
process I have plucked, I hold, every little flower of a
&ldquo;subject&rdquo; pressed between the leaves of these
volumes.&nbsp; I am tempted indeed to make for my original
lucidity the claim of something more than bare
prudence&mdash;almost that of a happy instinctive
foresight.&nbsp; This is what I mean by having been
&ldquo;well-advised.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was as if I had, vulgarly
speaking, received quite at first the &ldquo;straight
tip&rdquo;&mdash;to <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>back the right horse or buy the right shares.&nbsp; The
mixture of manners was to become in other words not a less but a
very much more appreciable and interesting subject of
study.&nbsp; The mixture of manners was in fine to loom large and
constantly larger all round; it was to be a matter, plainly,
about which the future would have much to say.&nbsp; Nothing
appeals to me more, I confess, as a &ldquo;critic of life&rdquo;
in any sense worthy of the name, than the finer&mdash;if indeed
thereby the less easily formulated&mdash;group of the conquests
of civilisation, the multiplied symptoms among educated people,
from wherever drawn, of a common intelligence and a social fusion
tending to abridge old rigours of separation.&nbsp; This too, I
must admit, in spite of the many-coloured sanctity of such
rigours in general, which have hitherto made countries smaller
but kept the globe larger, and by which immediate strangeness,
immediate beauty, immediate curiosity were so much
fostered.&nbsp; Half our instincts work for the maintained
differences; without them, for instance, what would have been the
point of the history of poor Lady Barbarina?&nbsp; I have but to
put that question, I must add, to feel it beautifully large; for
there looms before me at its touch the vision of a Lady Barbarina
reconciled, domesticated, developed, of possibly greater
vividness than the quite other vision expressed in these
pages.&nbsp; It is a question, however, of the tendency,
perceptive as well as reflective too, of the braver
imagination&mdash;which faculty, in our future, strikes me as
likely to be appealed to much less by the fact, by the pity and
the misery and the greater or less grotesqueness, of the
courageous, or even of the timid, missing their lives beyond
certain stiff barriers, than by the picture of their more and
more steadily making out their opportunities and their possible
communications.&nbsp; Behind all the small comedies and tragedies
of the <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>international, in a word, has exquisitely lurked for me
the idea of some eventual sublime consensus of the educated; the
exquisite conceivabilities of which, intellectual, moral,
emotional, sensual, social, political&mdash;all, I mean, in the
face of felt difficulty and danger&mdash;constitute stuff for
such &ldquo;situations&rdquo; as may easily make many of those of
a more familiar type turn pale.&nbsp; <i>There</i>, if one
will&mdash;in the dauntless fusions to come&mdash;is the personal
drama of the future.</p>
<p>We are far from it certainly&mdash;as I have delayed much too
long to remark&mdash;in the chronicle of Lady Barb.&nbsp; I have
placed this composition (1888) at the top of my list, in the
present cluster, despite the earlier date of some of its
companions; consistently giving it precedence by reason of its
greatest length.&nbsp; The idea at the root of it scarcely brooks
indication, so inevitable had it surely become, in all the
conditions, that a young Englishwoman in some such predicament
should figure as the happy pictorial thought.&nbsp; The whole
thing rests, I need scarce point out, on the most primitive
logic.&nbsp; The international relation had begun to present
itself &ldquo;socially,&rdquo; after the liveliest fashion, a
quarter of a century ago and earlier, as a relation of
intermarrying; but nothing was meanwhile so striking as that
these manifestations took always the same turn.&nbsp; The
European of &ldquo;position&rdquo; married the young American
woman, or the young American woman married the European of
position&mdash;one scarce knew how best to express the regularity
of it; but the social field was scanned in vain for a different
pairing.&nbsp; No American citizen appeared to offer his hand to
the &ldquo;European&rdquo; girl, or if he did so offered it in
vain.&nbsp; The bridal migrations were eastward without
exception&mdash;as rigidly as if settled by statute.&nbsp; Custom
clearly had acquired the force of law; a fact remarkable,
significant, interesting and even amusing.&nbsp; And yet, withal,
<a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>it
seemed scarce to demand explanations.&nbsp; So far as they
appeared indeed they were confident on the American side.&nbsp;
The representatives of that interest had no call in life to go
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; for their wives&mdash;having obviously
close at hand the largest and choicest assortment of such
conveniences; as was sufficiently proved by the European
&ldquo;run&rdquo; on the market.&nbsp; What American run on any
foreign market had been noted?&mdash;save indeed always on the
part of the women!&nbsp; It all redounded to the honour and glory
of the young woman grown in American conditions&mdash;to cast
discredit on whose general peerlessness by attested preference
for other types could but strike the domestic aspirant as an act
of disloyalty or treachery.&nbsp; It was just the observed rarity
of the case therefore that prompted one to put it to the
imaginative test.&nbsp; Any case so unlikely to
happen&mdash;taking it for at all conceivable&mdash;could only be
worth attention when it <i>should</i>, once in a blue moon,
occur.&nbsp; There was nothing meanwhile, in truth, to &ldquo;go
by&rdquo;; we had seen the American girl &ldquo;of
position&rdquo; absorbed again and again into the European social
system, but we had only seen young foreign candidates for places
as cooks and housemaids absorbed into the American.&nbsp; The
more one viewed the possible instance, accordingly, the more it
appealed to speculative study; so that, failing all valid
testimony, one had studiously, as it were, to forge the very
documents.</p>
<p>I have only to add that I found mine, once I had produced
them, thoroughly convincing: the most one could do, in the
conditions, was to make one&rsquo;s picture appear to hang
together, and I should have broken down, no doubt, had my own,
after a superficial question or two, not struck me as decently
hanging.&nbsp; The essential, at the threshold, I seem to recall,
was to get my young man right&mdash;I somehow <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>quite
took for granted the getting of my young woman.&nbsp; Was this
because, for the portrait of Lady Barb, I felt appealed to so
little in the name of <i>shades</i>?&nbsp; Shades would be
decidedly neither of her general world nor of her particular
consciousness: the image I had in view was a maiden nature that,
after a fashion all its own, should show as fine and complete,
show as neither coarse nor poor, show above all as a resultant of
many causes, quite without them.&nbsp; I felt in short sure of
Lady Barb, and I think there is no question about her, or about
the depth of root she might strike in American soil, that I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been ready on the spot to answer.&nbsp; Such
is the luck of the conception that imposes itself <i>en
bloc</i>&mdash;or such at least the artist&rsquo;s luck in face
of it; such certainly, to begin with and
&ldquo;subjectively&rdquo; speaking, is the great advantage of a
character all of a piece: immediacy of representation, the best
omens for felicity, then so honourably await it.&nbsp; It was
Jackson Lemon and <i>his</i> shades, comparatively, and his
comparative sense for shades, that, in the tale, most interested
me.&nbsp; The one thing fine-drawn in his wife was that she had
been able to care for him as he was: to almost every one and
every thing else equally American, to almost every one and
everything else so sensibly stamped, toned and warranted, she was
to find herself quite otherwise affected.&nbsp; With her husband
the law was reversed&mdash;he had, much rather, imputed authority
and dignity, imputed weight and charm, to the antecedents of
which she was so fine and so direct a consequence; his estimate,
his appreciation of her being founded thus on a vision of
innumerable close correspondences.&nbsp; It is that vision in him
that is racked, and at so many fine points, when he finds their
experiment come so near failure; all of which&mdash;at least as I
seem to see it again so late in the day&mdash;lights his inward
drama as with the never-quenched <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>lamp of a sacred place.&nbsp; His
wife&rsquo;s, on the other hand, goes on in comparatively close
darkness.</p>
<p>It is indeed late in the day that I thus project the ray of
<i>my</i> critical lantern, however; for it comes over me even as
I write that the general air in which most of these particular
flowers of fancy bloom is an air we have pretty well ceased to
breathe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Barbarina&rdquo; is, as I have said,
scarce a quarter of a century old; but so many of the perceived
conditions in which it took birth have changed that the account
of them embodied in that tale and its associates will already
pass for ancient history.&nbsp; &ldquo;Civilisation&rdquo; and
education move fast, after all, and too many things have
happened; too many <i>sorts</i> of things, above all, seem more
and more likely to happen.&nbsp; This multiplication of kinds of
occurrences, I make no doubt, will promote the inspiration of
observers and poets to come; but it may meanwhile well make for
an effect of superannuation in any record of the leaner
years.&nbsp; Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s has become a more frequent
adventure, and Lady Barbarina is to-day as much at her ease in
New York, in Washington, at Newport, as in London or in
Rome.&nbsp; If this is her case, moreover, it is still more that
of little Mrs. Headway, of &ldquo;The Siege of London&rdquo;
(1883), who suffers, I feel, by the sad circumstance that her
type of complication, or, more exactly speaking perhaps, that of
the gentlemen concerned with her, is no longer eminent, or at
least salient.&nbsp; Both she and her friends have had too many
companions and successors; so that to reinvest them with historic
importance, with individual dignity, I have to think of them
rather as brave precursors, as adventurous skirmishers and
<i>&eacute;claireurs</i>.&nbsp; This doesn&rsquo;t diminish, I
recognise, any interest that may reside in the form either of
&ldquo;The Siege&rdquo; aforesaid or of its congeners &ldquo;An
International Episode,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Bundle <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>of
Letters&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pension Beaurepas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or
rather indeed perhaps I should distinguish among these things
and, if presuming to claim for several some hint of the
distinction we may see exemplified in any first-class art-museum,
the distinction of the archaic subject treated by a
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; master of high finish, yet notice duly
that others are no more &ldquo;quaint&rdquo; than need be.&nbsp;
What has really happened, I think, is that the <i>great</i>
international cases, those that bristle with fifty sorts of
social reference and overflow, and, by the same token, with a
hundred illustrations of social incoherence, are now equally
taken for granted on all sides of the sea, have simply become
incidents and examples of the mixture of manners, as I call it,
and the thicker fusion: which may mean nothing more, in truth,
but that social incoherence (with the sense for its opposite
practically extinct among the nations) has at last got itself
accepted, right and left, as normal.</p>
<p>So much, as I put it, for the great cases; but a certain
freshness, I make out, still hangs strangely enough about the
smaller and the more numerous; those to which we owe it that such
anecdotes&mdash;in my general array&mdash;as
&ldquo;Pandora,&rdquo; as &ldquo;Fordham Castle,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;Flickerbridge,&rdquo; as &ldquo;Miss Gunton of
Poughkeepsie,&rdquo; are by no means false even to present
appearances.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Pension Beaurepas&rdquo; is not
alone, thanks to some of its associations, in glowing for me with
the tender grace of a day that is dead; and yet, though the
accidents and accessories, in such a picture, may have been
marked for change, why shall not the essence of the matter, the
situation of Mr. and Mrs. Ruck and their daughter at old
Geneva&mdash;for there is of course a new, a newer
Geneva&mdash;freely recur?&nbsp; I am careful to put it as a
question, and all for a particular reason&mdash;the reason that,
to be frank, I find myself, before the vast diluvian <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>occidental
presence in Europe, with its remorseless rising tide and its
positive expression of almost nothing but quantity and number,
deprived, on definite and ample grounds, of the precious faculty
of confidence.&nbsp; This confidence was of old all instinctive,
in face of the &ldquo;common run&rdquo; of appearances, the even
then multitudinous, miscellaneous minor international phenomena,
those of which the &ldquo;short story,&rdquo; as
contemporaneously practised, could effect a fairly prompt and
easy notation; but it is now unmistakable that to come forth,
from whatever privacy, to almost any one of the great European
highways, and more particularly perhaps to approach the ports of
traffic for the lately-developed and so flourishing
&ldquo;southern route&rdquo; from New York and Boston, is to
encounter one of those big general questions that sturdily brush
away the multiplication of small answers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are
they, what are they, whence and whither and why,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;critic of life,&rdquo; international or other, still, or
more and more, asks himself, as he of course always asked, but
with the actual difference that the reply that used to come so
conveniently straight, &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re just the
American vague variety of the dear old Anglo-Saxon race,&rdquo;
not only hangs fire and leaves him to wait and wonder, but really
affects him as having for this act of deference (as to which he
can&rsquo;t choose, I admit) little more than a conscious
mocking, baffling, in fact a just all but sinister,
grimace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew, or even
<i>could</i> know?&rdquo; the inscrutable grin seems to convey;
and with resources of cynicism behind it not in the least to be
disturbed by any such cheap retort as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish
that, on your side, <i>you</i> could say&mdash;or even, for your
own convenience, so much as guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For there is no communicating to the diluvian presence, on
such a scale, any suspicion that convenience <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>shall
anywhere fail it: all its consciousness, on that general head, is
that of itself representing and actively <i>being</i> the biggest
convenience of the world.&nbsp; Little need to insist on the
guarantee of subjective ease involved in such an
attitude&mdash;the immense noted growth of which casts its chill,
as I intimate, on the inquirer proceeding from settled
premisses.&nbsp; He was aware formerly, when it came to an
analysis, of all his presumptions; he had but to glance for an
immemorial assurance at a dozen of the myriad
&ldquo;registers&rdquo; disposed in the vestibules of bankers,
the reading-rooms of hotels and &ldquo;exchanges,&rdquo; open on
the most conspicuous table of visited palace and castle, to see
them bristle with names of a more or less conceivable
tradition.&nbsp; Queer enough often, whether in isolation or in
association, were these gages of identity: but their queerness,
not independent of some more or less traceable weird law, was
exactly, after all, their most familiar note.&nbsp; They had
their way of not breaking, through it all, the old sweet
Anglo-Saxon spell; they had their way of not failing, when all
was said, to suggest more communities and comprehensions than
conundrums and &ldquo;stunts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would be brave,
however, who should say that any such ghost of a quiet conformity
presides in the fulness of time over the interminable
passenger-lists that proclaim the prosperity of the great
conveying companies.&nbsp; If little books have their fates,
little names&mdash;and long ones still more&mdash;have their
eloquence; the emphasis of nominal reference in the general
roll-call falls so strongly upon alien syllables and sounds,
representative signs that fit into our &ldquo;English&rdquo;
legend (as we were mainly conscious up to a few years since of
having inherited that boon) scarcely more than if borrowed from
the stony slabs of Nineveh.&nbsp; I may not here attempt to weigh
the question of what these exotic symbols <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>positively represent&mdash;a prodigious question, I
cannot but think; I content myself with noting the difference
made for fond fancy by the so rapidly established change, by the
so considerable drop of old associations.&nbsp; The point is of
one&rsquo;s having the heart to assume that the Ninevites, as I
may momentarily call them for convenience, are to be constantly
taken as feeling in the same way about fifty associational
matters as we used, in all satisfaction, to observe our earlier
generations feel.&nbsp; One can but speak for one&rsquo;s self,
and my imagination, on the great highways, I find, doesn&rsquo;t
rise to such people, who are obviously beyond my
divination.&nbsp; They strike one, above all, as giving no
account of themselves in any terms already consecrated by human
use; to this inarticulate state they probably form, collectively,
the most unprecedented of monuments; abysmal the mystery of what
they think, what they feel, what they want, what they suppose
themselves to be saying.&nbsp; There would appear to be to-day no
slim scrap even of a Daisy Miller to bridge the chasm; no
light-footed Francie Dosson or Pandora Day to dance before one
across the wavering plank.</p>
<p>I plead a blank of memory as to the origin of &ldquo;The Siege
of London&rdquo;; I get no nearer to the birth of the idea than
by recalling a certain agitation of the spirit, a lively
irritation of the temper, under which, one evening early in the
autumn of 1877, that is more than thirty years ago, I walked away
from the close of a performance at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais.&nbsp; The play had been &ldquo;Le
Demi-Monde&rdquo; of the younger Dumas, a masterpiece which I had
not heard for the first time, but a particular feature of which
on this occasion more than ever yet filled up the measure of my
impatience.&nbsp; I could less than ever swallow it, Olivier de
Jalin&rsquo;s denunciation of Madame d&rsquo;Ange; the play, from
the beginning, marches toward it&mdash;it is the <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>main hinge
of the action; but the very perfection with which the part was
rendered in those years by Delaunay (just as Croizette was pure
perfection as Suzanne) seemed to have made me present at
something inhuman and odious.&nbsp; It was the old
story&mdash;that from the positive, the prodigious
<i>morality</i> of such a painter of the sophisticated life as
Dumas, not from anything else or less edifying, one must pray to
be delivered.&nbsp; There are doubtless many possible views of
such a dilemma as Olivier&rsquo;s, the conflict of propriety for
him between the man he likes and esteems and the woman he has
loved but hasn&rsquo;t esteemed and doesn&rsquo;t, and as to whom
he sees his friend blind, and, as he thinks, befooled; in
consequence of which I am not re-judging his case.&nbsp; But I
recover with a pensive pleasure that is almost all a pang the
intensity with which I could then feel it; to the extent of
wondering whether the general situation of the three persons
concerned, or something like it, mightn&rsquo;t be shown as
taking quite another turn.&nbsp; Was there not conceivable an
Olivier of our race, a different Olivier altogether, moved to ask
himself how at such a juncture a &ldquo;real gentleman,&rdquo;
distressed and perplexed, would yet most naturally act?&nbsp; The
question would be interesting, it was easy to judge, if only by
the light it might throw on some of the other, the antecedent and
concomitant, phases of a real gentleman&rsquo;s connexion
&ldquo;at all at all&rdquo; with such a business and such a
world.&nbsp; It remained with me, at all events, and was to prove
in time the germ of &ldquo;The Siege of London&rdquo;; of the
conception of which the state of mind so reflected strikes me as
making, I confess, very ancient history.</p>
<p>Far away and unspeakably regretted the days, alas, or, more
exactly, the nights, on which one could walk away from the
Fran&ccedil;ais under the spell of such fond convictions and such
deep and agitating <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>problems.&nbsp; The emphasis of the international
proposition has indeed had time, as I say, to place itself
elsewhere&mdash;if, for that matter, there be any emphasis or any
proposition left at all&mdash;since the age when that particular
pleasure seemed the keenest in life.&nbsp; A few months ago, one
evening, I found myself withdrawing from the very temple and the
supposedly sacred rites before these latter were a third over:
beneath that haunted dome itself they seemed to have become at
last so accessible, cynically making their bargain with them, to
the profanations long kept at bay.&nbsp; Only, with that
evolution of taste possible on the part of the old worshipper in
question, what world-convulsions mightn&rsquo;t, in general, well
have taken place?&nbsp; Let me continue to speak of the rest of
the matter here before us as therefore of almost prehistoric
reference.&nbsp; I was to make, in due course, at any rate, my
limited application of that glimmering image of a M. de Jalin
with whom we might have more fellow-feeling, and I sent
&ldquo;The Siege of London&rdquo; accordingly to my admirable
friend the late Leslie Stephen, then editor of <i>The Cornhill
Magazine</i>, where it appeared during the first two months of
1883.&nbsp; That is all I remember about it save always the
particular London light in which at that period I invoked the
muse and drove the pen and with which the compositions resulting
strike my fancy to-day as so closely interfused that in reading
over those of them I here preserve every aspect and element of my
scene of application lives again for me.&nbsp; This scene
consisted of small chambers in a small street that opened, at a
very near corner, into Piccadilly and a view of the Green Park; I
had dropped into them almost instantaneously, under the accepted
heavy pressure of the autumnal London of 1876, and was to sit
scribbling in them for nearly ten years.&nbsp; The big human
rumble of Piccadilly (all human <a name="pagexxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>and equine then and long after) was
close at hand; I liked to think that Thackeray&rsquo;s Curzon
Street, in which Becky Sharp, or rather Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, had
lived, was not much further off: I thought of it preponderantly,
in my comings and goings, as Becky&rsquo;s and her
creator&rsquo;s; just as I was to find fifty other London
neighbourhoods speak to me almost only with the voice, the
thousand voices, of Dickens.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;great house,&rdquo; forming the south-west corner of
Piccadilly and with its long and practically featureless side,
continued by the high wall of its ample court, opposite my
open-eyed windows, gloomed, in dusty brick, as the extent of my
view, but with a vast convenient neutrality which I found, soon
enough, protective and not inquisitive, so that whatever there
was of my sedentary life and regular habits took a sort of local
wealth of colour from the special greyish-brown tone of the
surface always before me.&nbsp; This surface hung there like the
most voluminous of curtains&mdash;it masked the very stage of the
great theatre of the town.&nbsp; To sit for certain hours at
one&rsquo;s desk before it was somehow to occupy in the most
suitable way in the world the proportionately ample interacts of
the mightiest of dramas.&nbsp; When I went out it was as if the
curtain rose; so that, to repeat, I think of my tolerably copious
artistry of that time as all the fruit of the interacts, with the
curtain more or less quietly down and with the tuning of fiddles
and only the vague rumble of shifted scenery playing round it and
through it.&nbsp; There were absences of course: &ldquo;A Bundle
of Letters,&rdquo; here reproduced, took birth (1879) during
certain autumn weeks spent in Paris, where a friend of those
years, a young London journalist, the late Theodore Child (of
Merton College, Oxford, who was to die, prematurely and
lamentedly, during a gallant professional tour of exploration in
Persia) <a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>was fondly carrying on, under difficulties, an
Anglo-American periodical called <i>The Parisian</i>.&nbsp; He
invited me to contribute to its pages, and, again, a small
sharply-resonant street off the Rue de la Paix, where all
existence somehow went on as a repercussion from well-brushed
asphalt, lives for me as the scene of my response.&nbsp; A
snowstorm of a violence rare in Paris raged, I recollect, for
many hours, for the greater part of a couple of days; muffling me
noiselessly into the small shiny shabby salon of an
<i>h&ocirc;tel garni</i> with a droll combinational, almost
cosmic sign, and promoting (it comes back to me) a deep
concentration, an unusual straightness of labour.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
Bundle of Letters&rdquo; was written in a single long session
and, the temperature apart, at a &ldquo;heat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
companion-piece, &ldquo;The Point of View,&rdquo; marks not less
for memory, I find, an excursion associated with diligence.&nbsp;
I have no heart to &ldquo;go into&rdquo; these mere ingenious and
more or less effective pleasantries to any tune beyond this of
glancing at the <i>other</i>, the extinct, actualities they hold
up the glimmering taper to.&nbsp; They are still faintly scented,
doubtless, with something of that authenticity, and a living work
of art, however limited, pretends always, as for part of its
grace, to some good faith of community, however indirect, with
its period and place.</p>
<p>To read over &ldquo;The Point of View&rdquo; has opened up for
me, I confess, no contentious vista whatever, nothing but the
faded iridescence of a far-away Washington spring.&nbsp; This, in
1881, had been my first glimpse of that interesting city, where I
then spent a few weeks, a visit repeated the following year; and
I remember beginning on the first occasion a short imaginary
correspondence after the pattern of the then already published
&ldquo;Bundle of Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; After an absence from
America of some five years I inevitably, on the spot again, had
impressions; <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>and not less inevitably and promptly, I remember,
recognised the truth that if one really was subject to such, and
to a good many, and they were at all worth entertaining or
imparting, one was likely to bristle with a quite proportionately
smaller number of neat and complacent conclusions.&nbsp;
Impressions could mutually conflict&mdash;which was exactly the
interest of them; whereas in ninety-nine connexions out of a
hundred, conclusions could but raise the wind for large groups of
persons incapable, to all appearance, of intelligently opening
their eyes, though much occupied, to make up for it, with
opening, and all vociferously, their mouths.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Point of View,&rdquo; in fine, I fear, was but to commemorate,
punctually enough, its author&rsquo;s perverse and incurable
disposition to interest himself less in his own (always so
quickly stale) experience, under certain sorts of pressure, than
in that of conceivable fellow mortals, which might be
mysteriously and refreshingly different.&nbsp; The thing indeed
may also serve, in its degree, as a punctual small monument to a
recognition that was never to fail; that of the nature of the
burden bequeathed by such rash multiplications of the candid
consciousness.&nbsp; They are splendid for experience, the
multiplications, each in its way an intensifier; but expression,
liking things above all to be made comfortable and easy for it,
views them askance.&nbsp; The case remains, none the
less&mdash;alas for this faculty!&mdash;that no representation of
life worth speaking of can go forward without them.&nbsp; All of
which will perhaps be judged to have but a strained relevance,
however, to the fact that, though the design of the short
imaginary correspondence I speak of was interrupted during those
first weeks in Washington, a second visit, the following spring,
served it better; I had kept the thread (through a return to
London and a return again thence) and, if I remember <a
name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>rightly,
I brought my small scheme to a climax on the spot.&nbsp; The
finished thing appeared in <i>The Century Magazine</i> of
December 1882.&nbsp; I recently had the chance to &ldquo;look
up,&rdquo; for old sake&rsquo;s sake, that momentary seat of the
good-humoured satiric muse&mdash;the seats of the muses, even
when the merest flutter of one of their robes has been involved,
losing no scrap of sanctity for me, I profess, by the accident of
my having myself had the honour to offer the visitant the
chair.&nbsp; The chair I had anciently been able to push forward
in Washington had not, I found, survived the ravage of nearly
thirty years; its place knew it no more, infirm and precarious
dependence as it had struck me even at the time as being.&nbsp;
So, quite exquisitely, as whenever that lapse occurs, the lost
presence, the obliterated scene, translated itself for me at last
into terms of almost more than earthly beauty and poetry.&nbsp;
Fifty intimate figures and objects flushed with life in the other
time had passed away since then; a great chapter of history had
made itself, tremendous things had happened; the ghosts of old
cherished names, of old tragedies, of old comedies, even of old
mere mystifications, had marshalled their array.&nbsp; Only the
little rounded composition remained; which glowed, ever so
strangely, like a swinging playing lantern, with a light that
brought out the past.&nbsp; The past had been most concretely
that vanished and slightly sordid tenement of the current housing
of the muse.&nbsp; I had had &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; in it, and I
could remember how the rooms, how the whole place, a nest of
rickety tables and chairs, lame and disqualified utensils of
every sort, and of smiling shuffling procrastinating persons of
colour, had exhaled for me, to pungency, the domestic spirit of
the &ldquo;old South.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had nursed the unmistakable
scent; I had read history by its aid; I had learned more than I
could say of what had anciently <a name="pagexxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>been the matter under the reign of
the great problem of persons of colour&mdash;so badly the matter,
by my vision, that a deluge of blood and fire and tears had been
needed to correct it.&nbsp; These complacencies of perception
swarmed for me again&mdash;while yet no brick of the little old
temple of the revelation stood on another.</p>
<p>I could scarcely have said where the bricks <i>had</i> stood;
the other, the superseded Washington of the exquisite springtime,
of the earlier initiation, of the hovering plaintive ghosts,
reduced itself to a great vague blur of warmth and colour and
fragrance.&nbsp; It kept flushing through the present&mdash;very
much as if I had had my small secret for making it.&nbsp; I could
turn on my finger the magic ring&mdash;it was strange how slight
a thing, a mere handful of pages of light persistent prose, could
act as that talisman.&nbsp; So, at all events, I like to date,
and essentially to synchronise, these sincere little studies in
general.&nbsp; Nothing perhaps can vouch better for their having
applied to conditions that superficially at least have changed
than the fact that to fond memory&mdash;I speak of my
own&mdash;there hangs about the last item on this list, the
picture of &ldquo;The Pension Beaurepas,&rdquo; the unearthly
poetry, as I call it, of the Paquis, and that I should yet have
to plunge into gulfs of explanation as to where and what the
Paquis may have been.&nbsp; An old-world nook of one&rsquo;s
youth was so named, a scrap of the lakeside fringe of ancient
Geneva, now practically quite reformed and improved away.&nbsp;
The Pension Beaurepas, across the years, looks to me prodigiously
archaic and incredibly quaint; I ask myself why, at the time, I
so wasted the precious treasure of a sense that absolutely
primitive pre-revolutionary &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; had never really
been swept out of its cupboards, shaken out of its curtains,
thumped out of its mattresses.&nbsp; The echoes of the <a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>eighteenth century, to go no further back, must have
been thick on its rather greasy stone staircase, up down which,
unconscious of the character of the fine old wrought-iron
<i>rampe</i>, as of most other things in the world besides, Mr.
and Mrs. and Miss Ruck, to speak only of them, used mournfully to
straggle.&nbsp; But I mustn&rsquo;t really so <i>much</i> as
speak only, as even speak, of them.&nbsp; They would carry me too
far back&mdash;which possibly outlived verisimilitude in them is
what I wish to acknowledge.</p>

BARBARINA</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I</h3>
<p>It is well known that there are few sights in the world more
brilliant than the main avenues of Hyde Park of a fine afternoon
in June.&nbsp; This was quite the opinion of two persons who on a
beautiful day at the beginning of that month, four years ago, had
established themselves under the great trees in a couple of iron
chairs&mdash;the big ones with arms, for which, if I mistake not,
you pay twopence&mdash;and sat there with the slow procession of
the Drive behind them while their faces were turned to the more
vivid agitation of the Row.&nbsp; Lost in the multitude of
observers they belonged, superficially at least, to that class of
persons who, wherever they may be, rank rather with the
spectators than with the spectacle.&nbsp; They were quiet simple
elderly, of aspect somewhat neutral; you would have liked them
extremely but would scarcely have noticed them.&nbsp; It is to
them, obscure in all that shining host, that we must nevertheless
give our attention.&nbsp; On which the reader is begged to have
confidence; he is not asked to make vain concessions.&nbsp; It
was indicated touchingly in the faces of our friends that they
were growing old together and were fond enough of each
other&rsquo;s company not to object&mdash;since it was a
condition&mdash;even to that.&nbsp; The reader will have guessed
that they were husband and wife; and perhaps while he is about it
will further have guessed that they were of that nationality for
which <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Hyde
Park at the height of the season is most completely
illustrative.&nbsp; They were native aliens, so to speak, and
people at once so initiated and so detached could only be
Americans.&nbsp; This reflexion indeed you would have made only
after some delay; for it must be allowed that they bristled with
none of those modern signs that carry out the tradition of the
old indigenous war-paint and feathers.&nbsp; They had the
American turn of mind, but that was very secret; and to your
eye&mdash;if your eye had cared about it&mdash;they might have
been either intimately British or more remotely foreign.&nbsp; It
was as if they studied, for convenience, to be superficially
colourless; their colour was all in their talk.&nbsp; They were
not in the least verdant; they were grey rather, of monotonous
hue.&nbsp; If they were interested in the riders, the horses, the
walkers, the great exhibition of English wealth and health,
beauty, luxury and leisure, it was because all this referred
itself to other impressions, because they had the key to almost
everything that needed an answer&mdash;because, in a word, they
were able to compare.&nbsp; They had not arrived, they had only
returned; and recognition much more than surprise was expressed
in their quiet eyes.&nbsp; Dexter Freer and his wife belonged in
fine to that great company of Americans who are constantly
&ldquo;passing through&rdquo; London.&nbsp; Enjoyers of a fortune
of which, from any standpoint, the limits were plainly visible,
they were unable to treat themselves to that commonest form of
ease, the ease of living at home.&nbsp; They found it much more
possible to economise at Dresden or Florence than at Buffalo or
Minneapolis.&nbsp; The saving was greater and the strain was
less.&nbsp; From Dresden, from Florence, moreover, they
constantly made excursions that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible
with an excess of territory; and it is even to be feared they
practised some eccentricities of thrift.&nbsp; They <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>came to London
to buy their portmanteaus, their toothbrushes, their
writing-paper; they occasionally even recrossed the Atlantic
westward to assure themselves that westward prices were still the
same.&nbsp; They were eminently a social pair; their interests
were mainly personal.&nbsp; Their curiosity was so invidiously
human that they were supposed to be too addicted to gossip, and
they certainly kept up their acquaintance with the affairs of
other people.&nbsp; They had friends in every country, in every
town; and it was not their fault if people told them their
secrets.&nbsp; Dexter Freer was a tall lean man, with an
interested eye and a nose that rather drooped than aspired, yet
was salient withal.&nbsp; He brushed his hair, which was streaked
with white, forward over his ears and into those locks
represented in the portraits of clean-shaven gentlemen who
flourished fifty years ago and wore an old-fashioned neckcloth
and gaiters.&nbsp; His wife, a small plump person, rather
polished than naturally fresh, with a white face and hair still
evenly black, smiled perpetually, but had never laughed since the
death of a son whom she had lost ten years after her
marriage.&nbsp; Her husband, on the other hand, who was usually
quite grave, indulged on great occasions in resounding
mirth.&nbsp; People confided in her less than in him, but that
mattered little, as she confided much in herself.&nbsp; Her
dress, which was always black or dark grey, was so harmoniously
simple that you could see she was fond of it; it was never smart
by accident or by fear.&nbsp; She was full of intentions of the
most judicious sort and, though perpetually moving about the
world, had the air of waiting for every one else to pass.&nbsp;
She was celebrated for the promptitude with which she made her
sitting-room at an inn, where she might be spending a night or
two, appear a real temple of memory.&nbsp; With books, flowers,
photographs, draperies, rapidly <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>distributed&mdash;she had even a way,
for the most part, of not failing of a piano&mdash;the place
seemed almost hereditary.&nbsp; The pair were just back from
America, where they had spent three months, and now were able to
face the world with something of the elation of people who have
been justified of a stiff conviction.&nbsp; They had found their
native land quite ruinous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is again!&rdquo; said Mr. Freer, following
with his eyes a young man who passed along the Row, riding
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beautiful
thoroughbred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Freer asked idle questions only when she wanted time to
think.&nbsp; At present she had simply to look and see who it was
her husband meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;The horse is too big,&rdquo; she
remarked in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the rider&rsquo;s too small,&rdquo; her
husband returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mounted on his
millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really millions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven or eight, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How disgusting!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was so that Mrs. Freer
usually spoke of the large fortunes of the day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish he&rsquo;d see us,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does see us, but he doesn&rsquo;t like to look at
us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s too conscious.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too conscious of his big horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and of his big fortune.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s rather
ashamed of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an odd place to hang one&rsquo;s head
in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll find people
here richer than himself, and other big horses in plenty, and
that will cheer him up.&nbsp; Perhaps too he&rsquo;s looking for
that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one we heard about?&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t be such a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a fool,&rdquo; said Dexter Freer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s thinking of her he has some good
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>&ldquo;I
wonder what Mary Lemon would say,&rdquo; his wife pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d say it was all right if he should do
it.&nbsp; She thinks he can do no wrong.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
immensely fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be sure of that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer,
&ldquo;if he takes home a wife who&rsquo;ll despise
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should the girl despise her?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
delightful woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl will never know it&mdash;and if she should it
would make no difference: she&rsquo;ll despise
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, my dear; she&rsquo;ll like
some things very much.&nbsp; Every one will be very nice to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll despise them all the more.&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;re speaking as if it were all arranged.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe in it at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, something of the sort&mdash;in this case or in
some other&mdash;is sure to happen sooner or later,&rdquo; her
husband replied, turning round a little toward the back-water, as
it were, formed, near the entrance to the Park, by the confluence
of the two great vistas of the Drive and the Row.</p>
<p>Our friends had turned their backs, as I have said, to the
solemn revolution of wheels and the densely-packed mass of
spectators who had chosen that aspect of the show.&nbsp; These
spectators were now agitated by a unanimous impulse: the
pushing-back of chairs, the shuffle of feet, the rustle of
garments and the deepening murmur of voices sufficiently
expressed it.&nbsp; Royalty was approaching&mdash;royalty was
passing&mdash;royalty had passed.&nbsp; Mr. Freer turned his head
and his ear a little, but failed to alter his position further,
and his wife took no notice of the flurry.&nbsp; They had seen
royalty pass, all over Europe, and they knew it passed very
quickly.&nbsp; Sometimes it came back; sometimes it didn&rsquo;t;
more than <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>once they had seen it pass for the last time.&nbsp; They
were veteran tourists and they knew as perfectly as regular
attendants at complicated church-services when to get up and when
to remain seated.&nbsp; Mr. Freer went on with his
proposition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some young fellow&rsquo;s certain to do
it, and one of these girls is certain to take the risk.&nbsp;
They must take risks over here more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girls, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, will be glad enough;
they have had very little chance as yet.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
want Jackson to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know I rather think I do,&rdquo; said Dexter
Freer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be so very amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us perhaps, but not for him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
repent of it and be wretched.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s too good for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretched never!&nbsp; He has no capacity for
wretchedness, and that&rsquo;s why he can afford to risk
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to make great concessions,&rdquo; Mrs.
Freer persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit, then, that it will be amusing: all I contend
for,&rdquo; her husband replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, as you say,
we&rsquo;re talking as if it were settled, whereas there&rsquo;s
probably nothing in it after all.&nbsp; The best stories always
turn out false.&nbsp; I shall be sorry in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They relapsed into silence while people passed and repassed
them&mdash;continuous successive mechanical, with strange facial,
strange expressional, sequences and contrasts.&nbsp; They watched
the procession, but no one heeded them, though every one was
there so admittedly to see what was to be seen.&nbsp; It was all
striking, all pictorial, and it made a great composition.&nbsp;
The wide long area of the Row, its red-brown surface dotted with
bounding figures, stretched away into the distance and became
suffused and misty <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>in the bright thick air.&nbsp; The deep dark English
verdure that bordered and overhung it looked rich and old,
revived and refreshed though it was by the breath of June.&nbsp;
The mild blue of the sky was spotted with great silvery clouds,
and the light drizzled down in heavenly shafts over the quieter
spaces of the Park, as one saw them beyond the Row.&nbsp; All
this, however, was only a background, for the scene was before
everything personal; quite splendidly so, and full of the gloss
and lustre, the contrasted tones, of a thousand polished
surfaces.&nbsp; Certain things were salient, pervasive&mdash;the
shining flanks of the perfect horses, the twinkle of bits and
spurs, the smoothness of fine cloth adjusted to shoulders and
limbs, the sheen of hats and boots, the freshness of complexions,
the expression of smiling talking faces, the flash and flutter of
rapid gallops.&nbsp; Faces were everywhere, and they were the
great effect&mdash;above all the fair faces of women on tall
horses, flushed a little under their stiff black hats, with
figures stiffened, in spite of much definition of curve, by their
tight-fitting habits.&nbsp; Their well-secured helmets, their
neat compact heads, their straight necks, their firm tailor-made
armour, their frequent hardy bloom, all made them look singularly
like amazons about to ride a charge.&nbsp; The men, with their
eyes before them, with hats of undulating brim, good profiles,
high collars, white flowers on their chests, long legs and long
feet, had an air more elaboratively decorative, as they jolted
beside the ladies, always out of step.&nbsp; These were the
younger types; but it was not all youth, for many a saddle
sustained a richer rotundity, and ruddy faces with short white
whiskers or with matronly chins looked down comfortably from an
equilibrium that seemed moral as well as physical.&nbsp; The
walkers differed from the riders only in being on foot and in
looking at the riders <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>more than these looked at them; for
they would have done as well in the saddle and ridden as the
others ride.&nbsp; The women had tight little bonnets and still
tighter little knots of hair; their round chins rested on a close
swathing of lace or in some cases on throttling silver chains and
circlets.&nbsp; They had flat backs and small waists, they walked
slowly, with their elbows out, carrying vast parasols and turning
their heads very little to the right or the left.&nbsp; They were
amazons unmounted, quite ready to spring into the saddle.&nbsp;
There was a great deal of beauty and a diffused look of happy
expansion, all limited and controlled, which came from clear
quiet eyes and well-cut lips, rims of stout vessels that
didn&rsquo;t overflow and on which syllables were liquid and
sentences brief.&nbsp; Some of the young men, as well as the
women, had the happiest proportions and oval faces&mdash;faces in
which line and colour were pure and fresh and the idea of the
moment far from intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re often very good-looking,&rdquo; said Mr.
Freer at the end of ten minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re on
the whole the finest whites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as they remain white they do very well; but
when they venture upon colour!&rdquo; his wife replied.&nbsp; She
sat with her eyes at the level of the skirts of the ladies who
passed her, and she had been following the progress of a green
velvet robe enriched with ornaments of steel and much gathered up
in the hands of its wearer, who, herself apparently in her teens,
was accompanied by a young lady draped in scant pink muslin, a
tissue embroidered esthetically with flowers that simulated the
iris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, in a crowd, they&rsquo;re wonderfully
well turned out,&rdquo; Dexter Freer went on&mdash;&ldquo;lumping
men and women and horses and dogs together.&nbsp; Look at that
big fellow on the light chestnut: what could be more
perfect?&nbsp; By the way, it&rsquo;s Lord <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Canterville,&rdquo; he added in a moment and as if the
fact were of some importance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Freer recognised its importance to the degree of raising
her glass to look at Lord Canterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
know it&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; she asked with that implement still
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard him say something the night I went to the House
of Lords.&nbsp; It was very few words, but I remember him.&nbsp;
A man near me mentioned who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not so handsome as you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Freer, dropping her glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re too difficult!&rdquo; her husband
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity the girl isn&rsquo;t with
him,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We might see
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared in a moment, however, that the girl was with
him.&nbsp; The nobleman designated had ridden slowly forward from
the start, then just opposite our friends had pulled up to look
back as if waiting for some one.&nbsp; At the same moment a
gentleman in the Walk engaged his attention, so that he advanced
to the barrier which protects the pedestrians and halted there,
bending a little from his saddle and talking with his friend, who
leaned against the rail.&nbsp; Lord Canterville was indeed
perfect, as his American admirer had said.&nbsp; Upwards of sixty
and of great stature and great presence, he was a thoroughly
splendid apparition.&nbsp; In capital preservation he had the
freshness of middle life&mdash;he would have been young indeed to
the eye if his large harmonious spread hadn&rsquo;t spoken of the
lapse of years.&nbsp; He was clad from head to foot in garments
of a radiant grey, and his fine florid countenance was surmounted
with a white hat of which the majestic curves were a triumph of
good form.&nbsp; Over his mighty chest disposed itself a beard of
the richest growth and of a colour, in spite of a few streaks
vaguely grizzled, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>to which the coat of his admirable horse appeared to be
a perfect match.&nbsp; It left no opportunity in his uppermost
button-hole for the customary orchid; but this was of
comparatively little consequence, since the vegetation of the
beard itself was tropical.&nbsp; Astride his great steed, with
his big fist, gloved in pearl-grey, on his swelling thigh, his
face lighted up with good-humoured indifference and all his
magnificent surface reflecting the mild sunshine, he was,
strikingly, a founded and builded figure, such as could only
represent to the public gaze some Institution, some Exhibition or
some Industry, in a word some unquenchable Interest.&nbsp; People
quite lingered to look up at him as they passed.&nbsp; His halt
was brief, however, for he was almost immediately joined by two
handsome girls, who were as well turned-out, in Dexter
Freer&rsquo;s phrase, as himself.&nbsp; They had been detained a
moment at the entrance to the Row and now advanced side by side,
their groom close behind them.&nbsp; One was noticeably taller
and older than the other, and it was plain at a glance that they
were sisters.&nbsp; Between them, with their charming shoulders,
their contracted waists and their skirts that hung without a
wrinkle, like plates of zinc, they represented in a singularly
complete form the pretty English girl in the position in which
she is prettiest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re his daughters,&rdquo; said
Dexter Freer as these young ladies rode away with Lord
Canterville; &ldquo;and in that case one of them must be Jackson
Lemon&rsquo;s sweetheart.&nbsp; Probably the bigger; they said it
was the eldest.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s evidently a fine
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d hate it over there,&rdquo; Mrs. Freer
returned for all answer to this cluster of inductions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t admit that.&nbsp; But granting
she should, it would do her good to have to accommodate
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t accommodate
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks so confoundedly fortunate, perched up on that
saddle,&rdquo; he went on without heed of his wife&rsquo;s
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they supposed to be very poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they look it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And his eyes followed
the eminent trio while, with the groom, as eminent in his way as
any of them, they started on a canter.</p>
<p>The air was full of sound, was low and economised; and when,
near our friends, it became articulate the words were simple and
few.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as the circus, isn&rsquo;t
it, Mrs. Freer?&rdquo;&nbsp; These words correspond to that
description, but they pierced the dense medium more effectually
than any our friends had lately heard.&nbsp; They were uttered by
a young man who had stopped short in the path, absorbed by the
sight of his compatriots.&nbsp; He was short and stout, he had a
round kind face and short stiff-looking hair, which was
reproduced in a small bristling beard.&nbsp; He wore a
double-breasted walking-coat, which was not, however, buttoned,
and on the summit of his round head was perched a hat of
exceeding smallness and of the so-called &ldquo;pot&rdquo;
category.&nbsp; It evidently fitted him, but a hatter himself
wouldn&rsquo;t have known why.&nbsp; His hands were encased in
new gloves of a dark-brown colour, and these masquerading members
hung consciously, quite ruefully, at his sides.&nbsp; He sported
neither umbrella nor stick.&nbsp; He offered one of his stuffed
gloves almost with eagerness to Mrs. Freer, blushing a little as
he measured his precipitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Doctor Feeder!&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled at him.&nbsp;
Then she repeated to her husband, &ldquo;Doctor Feeder, my
dear!&rdquo; and her husband said, &ldquo;Oh Doctor, how
d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo;&nbsp; I have spoken of the composition of
the young man&rsquo;s appearance, but the items were not
perceived by these two.&nbsp; They saw but one thing, his
delightful <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>face, which was both simple and clever and, as if this
weren&rsquo;t enough, showed a really tasteless overheaping of
the cardinal virtues.&nbsp; They had lately made the voyage from
New York in his company, and he was clearly a person who would
shine at sea with an almost intolerable blandness.&nbsp; After he
had stood in front of them a moment a chair beside Mrs. Freer
became vacant; on which he took possession of it and sat there
telling her what he thought of the Park and how he liked
London.&nbsp; As she knew every one she had known many of his
people at home, and while she listened to him she remembered how
large their contribution had been to the moral worth of
Cincinnati.&nbsp; Mrs. Freer&rsquo;s social horizon included even
that city; she had had occasion to exercise an amused recognition
of several families from Ohio and was acquainted with the
position of the Feeders there.&nbsp; This family, very numerous,
was interwoven into an enormous cousinship.&nbsp; She stood off
herself from any Western promiscuity, but she could have told you
whom Doctor Feeder&rsquo;s great-grandfather had married.&nbsp;
Every one indeed had heard of the good deeds of the descendants
of this worthy, who were generally physicians, excellent ones,
and whose name expressed not inaptly their numerous acts of
charity.&nbsp; Sidney Feeder, who had several cousins of this
name established in the same line at Cincinnati, had transferred
himself and his ambition to New York, where his practice had at
the end of three years begun to grow.&nbsp; He had studied his
profession at Vienna and was saturated with German science; had
he only worn spectacles he might indeed perfectly, while he
watched the performers in Rotten Row as if their proceedings were
a successful demonstration, have passed for some famously
&ldquo;materialistic&rdquo; young German.&nbsp; He had come over
to London to attend a medical congress which met this year in the
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>British
capital, for his interest in the healing art was by no means
limited to the cure of his patients.&nbsp; It embraced every form
of experiment, and the expression of his honest eyes would almost
have reconciled you to vivisection.&nbsp; This was his first time
of looking into the Park; for social experiments he had little
leisure.&nbsp; Being aware, however, that it was a very typical
and, as might be, symptomatic sight, he had conscientiously
reserved an afternoon and dressed himself carefully for the
occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a brilliant show,&rdquo;
he said to Mrs. Freer; &ldquo;it makes me wish I had a
mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little as he resembled Lord Canterville he
rode, as he would have gaily said, first-rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till Jackson Lemon passes again and you can stop
him and make him let you take a turn.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
jocular suggestion of Dexter Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is he here?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been looking out for
him and should like to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he go to your medical congress?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well yes, he attends&mdash;but isn&rsquo;t very
regular.&nbsp; I guess he goes out a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he does,&rdquo; said Mr. Freer; &ldquo;and if
he isn&rsquo;t very regular I guess he has a good reason.&nbsp; A
beautiful reason, a charming reason,&rdquo; he went on, bending
forward to look down toward the beginning of the Row.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me, what a lovely reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Feeder followed the direction of his eyes and after a
moment understood his allusion.&nbsp; Little Jackson Lemon
passed, on his big horse, along the avenue again, riding beside
one of the bright creatures who had come that way shortly before
under escort of Lord Canterville.&nbsp; His lordship followed in
conversation with the other, his younger daughter.&nbsp; As they
advanced Jackson Lemon turned his eyes to the multitude under the
trees, and it so happened that <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>they rested on the Dexter
Freers.&nbsp; He smiled, he raised his hat with all possible
friendliness, and his three companions turned to see whom he so
frankly greeted.&nbsp; As he settled his hat on his head he
espied the young man from Cincinnati, whom he had at first
overlooked; whereupon he laughed for the luck of it and waved
Sidney Feeder an airy salutation with his hand, reining in a
little at the same time just for an instant, as if he
half-expected this apparition to come and speak to him.&nbsp;
Seeing him with strangers, none the less, Sidney Feeder hung
back, staring a little as he rode away.</p>
<p>It is open to us to know that at this moment the young lady by
whose side he was riding put him the free question: &ldquo;Who
are those people you bowed to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some old friends of mine&mdash;Americans,&rdquo; said
Jackson Lemon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re Americans; there&rsquo;s
nothing anywhere but Americans now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, our turn&rsquo;s coming round!&rdquo; laughed
the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t say who they are,&rdquo; his
companion continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so difficult to say
who Americans are,&rdquo; she added before he had time to answer
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dexter Freer and his wife&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing
difficult about that.&nbsp; Every one knows them,&rdquo; Jackson
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of them,&rdquo; said the English
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s your fault and your misfortune.&nbsp;
I assure you everybody knows them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does everybody know the little man with the fat
face to whom you kissed your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kiss my hand, but I would if I had
thought of it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a great chum of mine&mdash;a
fellow-student at Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s <i>his</i> name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Feeder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s companion had a dandling pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are <i>all</i> your friends doctors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;some of them are in other
businesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they all in some business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them&mdash;save two or three like Dexter
Freer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dexter&rsquo; Freer?&nbsp; I thought you said
Doctor Freer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man gave a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You heard me
wrong.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got doctors on the brain, Lady
Barb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather glad,&rdquo; said Lady Barb, giving
the rein to her horse, who bounded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well yes, she&rsquo;s very handsome, the reason,&rdquo;
Doctor Feeder remarked as he sat under the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he going to marry her?&rdquo; Mrs. Freer
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry her?&nbsp; I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hope not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know nothing about her.&nbsp; I want to know
something about the woman that man marries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d like him to marry in
Cincinnati,&rdquo; Mrs. Freer not unadventurously threw out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not particular where it is; but I want
to know her first.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doctor Feeder was very
sturdy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in hopes you&rsquo;d know all about it,&rdquo;
said his other entertainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t kept up with him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard from a dozen people that he has been
always with her for the last month&mdash;and that kind of thing,
in England, is supposed to mean something.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t he
spoken of her when you&rsquo;ve seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he has only talked about the new treatment of
spinal meningitis.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very much interested in
spinal meningitis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;I wonder if he talks about it to Lady
Barb,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she anyway?&rdquo; the young man wanted to
know.</p>
<p>Well, his companions both let him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Barb
Clement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Lady Barb Clement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The daughter of Lord Canterville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Lord Canterville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dexter must tell you that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>And Dexter accordingly told him that the Marquis of
Canterville had been in his day a great sporting nobleman and an
ornament to English society, and had held more than once a high
post in her Majesty&rsquo;s household.&nbsp; Dexter Freer knew
all these things&mdash;how his lordship had married a daughter of
Lord Treherne, a very serious intelligent and beautiful woman who
had redeemed him from the extravagance of his youth and presented
him in rapid succession with a dozen little tenants for the
nurseries at Pasterns&mdash;this being, as Mr. Freer also knew,
the name of the principal seat of the Cantervilles.&nbsp; The
head of that house was a Tory, but not a particular dunce for a
Tory, and very popular in society at large; good-natured,
good-looking, knowing how to be rather remarkably free and yet
remain a <i>grand seigneur</i>, clever enough to make an
occasional telling speech and much associated with the fine old
English pursuits as well as with many of the new
improvements&mdash;the purification of the Turf, the opening of
the museums on Sunday, the propagation of coffee-taverns, the
latest ideas on sanitary reform.&nbsp; He disapproved of the
extension of the suffrage but had positively drainage on the
brain.&nbsp; It had been said of him at least once&mdash;and, if
this historian is not mistaken, in print&mdash;that he was just
the man to convey to the popular mind the impression that the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>British
aristocracy is still a living force.&nbsp; He was unfortunately
not very rich&mdash;for a man who had to exemplify such
truths&mdash;and of his twelve children no less than seven were
daughters.&nbsp; Lady Barb, Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s friend, was the
second; the eldest had married Lord Beauchemin.&nbsp; Mr. Freer
had caught quite the right pronunciation of this name, which he
successfully sounded as Bitumen.&nbsp; Lady Lucretia had done
very well, for her husband was rich and she had brought him
nothing to speak of; but it was hardly to be expected they would
all achieve such flights.&nbsp; Happily the younger girls were
still in the schoolroom, and before they had come up, Lady
Canterville, who was a woman of bold resource, would have worked
off the two that were out.&nbsp; It was Lady Agatha&rsquo;s first
season; she wasn&rsquo;t so pretty as her sister, but was thought
to be cleverer.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen people had spoken to him of
Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s being a great deal at the
Cantervilles.&nbsp; He was supposed to be enormously rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so he is,&rdquo; said Sidney Feeder, who had
listened to Mr. Freer&rsquo;s report with attention, with
eagerness even, but, for all its lucidity, with an air of
imperfect apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not so rich as they probably think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they want his money?&nbsp; Is that what
they&rsquo;re after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go straight to the point!&rdquo; Mrs. Freer rang
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; said her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good sort in
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s a doctor,&rdquo; Mrs. Freer
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have they got against that?&rdquo; asked Sidney
Feeder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, over here, you know, they only call them in to
prescribe,&rdquo; said his other friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
profession isn&rsquo;t&mdash;a&mdash;what you&rsquo;d call
aristocratic.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know it, and I don&rsquo;t
know that I want to know it.&nbsp; How do you mean,
aristocratic?&nbsp; What profession is?&nbsp; It would be rather
a curious one.&nbsp; Professions are meant to do the work of
professions; and what work&rsquo;s done without your sleeves
rolled up?&nbsp; Many of the gentlemen at the congress there are
quite charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like doctors very much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer;
&ldquo;my father was a doctor.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t marry
the daughters of marquises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Jackson wants to marry that
one,&rdquo; Sidney Feeder calmly argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possibly not&mdash;people are such asses,&rdquo;
said Dexter Freer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll have to
decide.&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d find out, by the way.&nbsp; You
can if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him&mdash;up at the congress; I can do
that.&nbsp; I suppose he has got to marry some one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The young man added in a moment: &ldquo;And she may be a good
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s said to be charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, it won&rsquo;t hurt him.&nbsp; I must
say, however, I&rsquo;m not sure I like all that about her
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I told you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all to their honour
and glory,&rdquo; said Mr. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they quite on the square?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like
those people in Thackeray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh if Thackeray could have done
<i>this</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Freer yearned over the lost
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean all this scene?&rdquo; asked the young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the marriage of a British noblewoman and an
American doctor.&nbsp; It would have been a subject for a master
of satire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see you do want it, my dear,&rdquo; said her
husband quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want it as a story, but I don&rsquo;t want it for
Doctor Lemon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Does he call himself &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo;
still?&rdquo; Mr. Freer asked of young Feeder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he does&mdash;I call him so.&nbsp; Of course
he doesn&rsquo;t practise.&nbsp; But once a doctor always a
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s doctrine for Lady Barb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney Feeder wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t <i>she</i>
got a title too?&nbsp; What would she expect him to be?&nbsp;
President of the United States?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a man of real
ability&mdash;he might have stood at the head of his
profession.&nbsp; When I think of that I want to swear.&nbsp;
What did his father want to go and make all that money
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must certainly be odd to them to see a
&lsquo;medical man&rsquo; with six or eight millions,&rdquo; Mr.
Freer conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They use much the same term as the Choctaws,&rdquo;
said his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, some of their own physicians make immense
fortunes,&rdquo; Sidney Feeder remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;be made a
baronet by the Queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, then he&rsquo;d be aristocratic,&rdquo; said the
young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why he should want
to marry over here; it seems to me to be going out of his
way.&nbsp; However, if he&rsquo;s happy I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;
I like him very much; he has &lsquo;A1&rsquo; ability.&nbsp; If
it hadn&rsquo;t been for his father he&rsquo;d have made a
splendid doctor.&nbsp; But, as I say, he takes a great interest
in medical science and I guess he means to promote it all he
can&mdash;with his big fortune.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be sure to keep
up his interest in research.&nbsp; He thinks we <i>do</i> know
something and is bound we shall know more.&nbsp; I hope she
won&rsquo;t lower him, the young marchioness&mdash;is that her
rank?&nbsp; And I hope they&rsquo;re really good people.&nbsp; He
ought to be very useful.&nbsp; I should want to know a good deal
about the foreign family I was going to marry into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked to me, riding there, as if he knew a <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>good deal
about the Clements,&rdquo; Dexter Freer said, getting to his feet
as his wife suggested they ought to be going; &ldquo;and he
looked to me pleased with the knowledge.&nbsp; There they come
down the other side.&nbsp; Will you walk away with us or will you
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him and ask him, and then come and tell
us&mdash;in Jermyn Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was Mrs.
Freer&rsquo;s parting injunction to Sidney Feeder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to come himself&mdash;tell him that,&rdquo;
her husband added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; said the young
man as his companions merged themselves in the crowd that now was
tending toward the gates.&nbsp; He went and stood by the barrier
and saw Doctor Lemon and his friends pull up at the entrance to
the Row, where they apparently prepared to separate.&nbsp; The
separation took some time and Jackson&rsquo;s colleague became
interested.&nbsp; Lord Canterville and his younger daughter
lingered to talk with two gentlemen, also mounted, who looked a
good deal at the legs of Lady Agatha&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; Doctor
Lemon and Lady Barb were face to face, very near each other, and
she, leaning forward a little, stroked the overlapping neck of
his glossy bay.&nbsp; At a distance he appeared to be talking and
she to be listening without response.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes,
he&rsquo;s making love to her,&rdquo; thought Sidney
Feeder.&nbsp; Suddenly her father and sister turned away to leave
the Park, and she joined them and disappeared while Jackson came
up on the left again as for a final gallop.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t
gone far before he perceived his comrade, who awaited him at the
rail; and he repeated the gesture Lady Barb had described as a
kiss of the hand, though it had not to his friend&rsquo;s eyes
that full grace.&nbsp; When he came within hail he pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had known you were coming here I&rsquo;d have
given you a mount,&rdquo; he immediately and bountifully <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>cried.&nbsp;
There was not in his person that irradiation of wealth and
distinction which made Lord Canterville glow like a picture; but
as he sat there with his neat little legs stuck out he looked
very bright and sharp and happy, wearing in his degree the aspect
of one of Fortune&rsquo;s favourites.&nbsp; He had a thin keen
delicate face, a nose very carefully finished, a quick eye, a
trifle hard in expression, and a fine dark moustache, a good deal
cultivated.&nbsp; He was not striking, but he had his intensity,
and it was easy to see that he had his purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many horses have you got&mdash;about forty?&rdquo;
his compatriot inquired in response to his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five hundred,&rdquo; said Jackson Lemon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you mount your friends&mdash;the three you were
riding with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount them?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got the best horses in
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they sell you this one?&rdquo; Sidney Feeder
continued in the same humorous strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo; said his friend
without heed of this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s an awful old screw.&nbsp; I wonder he
can carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get your hat?&rdquo; Jackson asked both
as a retort and as a relevant criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it in New York.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful.&nbsp; I wish I had brought
over one like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head&rsquo;s the thing&mdash;not the hat.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean yours&mdash;I mean mine,&rdquo; Sidney Feeder
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something very deep in your
question.&nbsp; I must think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jackson
Lemon; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never get to the bottom of it.&nbsp;
Are you having a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A glorious time.&nbsp; Have you been up
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Up among the doctors?&nbsp; No&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
had a lot of things to do,&rdquo; Jackson was obliged to
plead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;and his friend richly recovered
it&mdash;&ldquo;we had a very interesting discussion.&nbsp; I
made a few remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have told me.&nbsp; What were they
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the intermarriage of races from the point of
view&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And Sidney Feeder paused a moment,
occupied with the attempt to scratch the nose of the beautiful
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the point of view of the progeny, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; From the point of view of the old
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the old friends!&rdquo; Doctor Lemon exclaimed
with jocular crudity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that you&rsquo;re going to marry a young
marchioness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the speaker in the saddle became just a trifle
rigid, and his firm eyes penetrated the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
has played that on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Freer, whom I met just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Freer be hanged too.&nbsp; And who told
<i>them</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so many fashionable people.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad, how things are tattled!&rdquo; cried Jackson Lemon
with asperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it&rsquo;s true by the way you say
that,&rdquo; his friend ingenuously stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Freer and his wife believe it?&rdquo; Jackson went
on impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want you to go and see them.&nbsp; You can judge
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see them and tell them to mind their
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;In Jermyn Street; but I forget the number.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry the marchioness isn&rsquo;t one of ours,&rdquo;
Doctor Feeder continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should marry her she <i>would</i> be quick
enough.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see what difference it can make
to you,&rdquo; said Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;ll look down on the profession, and I
don&rsquo;t like that from your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will touch me more than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it <i>is</i> true?&rdquo; Doctor Feeder cried with
a finer appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t look down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re out of it all
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I mean to do no end of
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe that when I see it,&rdquo; said
Sidney Feeder, who was by no means perfectly incredulous, but who
thought it salutary to take that tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure you&rsquo;ve any right to work&mdash;you oughtn&rsquo;t to
have everything; you ought to leave the field to us, not take the
bread out of our mouths and get the <i>kudos</i>.&nbsp; You must
pay the penalty of being bloated.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have been
celebrated if you had continued to practise&mdash;more celebrated
than any one.&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t be now&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t be any way you fix it.&nbsp; Some one else is going
to be in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon listened to this, but without meeting the eyes
of the prophet; not, however, as if he were avoiding them, but as
if the long stretch of the Ride, now less and less obstructed,
irresistibly drew him off again and made his companion&rsquo;s
talk retarding.&nbsp; Nevertheless he answered deliberately and
kindly enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope it will be you, old
boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he bowed to a lady who rode past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely it will.&nbsp; I hope I make you feel
mean.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh awfully!&rdquo; Jackson cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the
more that I&rsquo;m not in the least engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you
come up to-morrow?&rdquo; Doctor Feeder went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, my dear fellow.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be
sure.&nbsp; By-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re lost anyway!&rdquo; sighed Sidney
Feeder as the other started away.</p>
<h3><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>II</h3>
<p>It was Lady Marmaduke, wife of Sir Henry of that clan, who had
introduced the amusing young American to Lady Beauchemin; after
which Lady Beauchemin had made him acquainted with her mother and
sisters.&nbsp; Lady Marmaduke too was of outland strain,
remaining for her conjugal baronet the most ponderable
consequence of a tour in the United States.&nbsp; At present, by
the end of ten years, she knew her London as she had never known
her New York, so that it had been easy for her to be, as she
called herself, Jackson&rsquo;s social godmother.&nbsp; She had
views with regard to his career, and these views fitted into a
scheme of high policy which, if our space permitted, I should be
glad to lay before the reader in its magnitude.&nbsp; She wished
to add an arch or two to the bridge on which she had effected her
transit from America; and it was her belief that Doctor Lemon
might furnish the materials.&nbsp; This bridge, as yet a somewhat
sketchy and rickety structure, she saw&mdash;in the
future&mdash;boldly stretch from one solid pier to another.&nbsp;
It could but serve both ways, for reciprocity was the keynote of
Lady Marmaduke&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; It was her belief that an
ultimate fusion was inevitable and that those who were the first
to understand the situation would enjoy the biggest returns from
it.&nbsp; The first time the young man had dined with her he met
Lady Beauchemin, who was her intimate friend.&nbsp; <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Lady
Beauchemin was remarkably gracious, asking him to come and see
her as if she really meant it.&nbsp; He in fact presented himself
and in her drawing-room met her mother, who happened to be
calling at the same moment.&nbsp; Lady Canterville, not less
friendly than her daughter, invited him down to Pasterns for
Eastertide, and before a month had passed it struck him that,
though he was not what he would have called intimate at any house
in London, the door of the house of Clement opened to him pretty
often.&nbsp; This seemed no small good fortune, for it always
opened upon a charming picture.&nbsp; The inmates were a blooming
and beautiful race, and their interior had an aspect of the
ripest comfort.&nbsp; It was not the splendour of New
York&mdash;as New York had lately begun to appear to the young
man&mdash;but an appearance and a set of conditions, of factors
as he used to say, not to be set in motion in that city by any
power of purchase.&nbsp; He himself had a great deal of money,
and money was good even when it was new; but old money was
somehow <i>more</i> to the shilling and the pound.&nbsp; Even
after he learned that Lord Canterville&rsquo;s fortune was less
present than past it was still the positive golden glow that
struck him.&nbsp; It was Lady Beauchemin who had told him her
father wasn&rsquo;t rich; having told him furthermore many
surprising things&mdash;things both surprising in themselves and
surprising on her lips.&nbsp; This was to come home to him afresh
that evening&mdash;the day he met Sidney Feeder in the
Park.&nbsp; He dined out in the company of Lady Beauchemin, and
afterwards, as she was alone&mdash;her husband had gone down to
listen to a debate&mdash;she offered to &ldquo;take him
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was going to several places, at some of
which he must be due.&nbsp; They compared notes, and it was
settled they should proceed together to the Trumpingtons&rsquo;,
whither, it appeared at eleven o&rsquo;clock, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>all the world
was proceeding, with the approach to the house choked for half a
mile with carriages.&nbsp; It was a close muggy night; Lady
Beauchemin&rsquo;s chariot, in its place in the rank, stood still
for long periods.&nbsp; In his corner beside her, through the
open window, Jackson Lemon, rather hot, rather oppressed, looked
out on the moist greasy pavement, over which was flung, a
considerable distance up and down, the flare of a
public-house.&nbsp; Lady Beauchemin, however, was not impatient,
for she had a purpose in her mind, and now she could say what she
wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really love her?&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the first
thing she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess so,&rdquo; Jackson Lemon answered as if
he didn&rsquo;t recognise the obligation to be serious.</p>
<p>She looked at him a moment in silence; he felt her gaze and,
turning his eyes, saw her face, partly shadowed, with the aid of
a street-lamp.&nbsp; She was not so pretty as Lady Barb; her
features had a certain sharpness; her hair, very light in colour
and wonderfully frizzled, almost covered her eyes, the expression
of which, however, together with that of her pointed nose and the
glitter of several diamonds, emerged from the gloom.&nbsp; What
she next said seemed somehow to fall in with that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to know.&nbsp; I never saw a man in
so vague a state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You push me a little too much; I must have time to
think of it,&rdquo; the young man returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
in my country they allow us plenty of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
several little oddities of expression, of which he was perfectly
conscious and which he found convenient, for they guarded him in
a society condemning a lonely New Yorker who proceeded by native
inspiration to much exposure; they ensured him the profit
corresponding with sundry sacrifices.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>He had no
great assortment of vernacular drolleries, conscious or
unconscious, to draw upon; but the occasional use of one,
discreetly chosen, made him appear simpler than he really was,
and reasons determined his desiring this result.&nbsp; He was not
simple; he was subtle, circumspect, shrewd&mdash;perfectly aware
that he might make mistakes.&nbsp; There was a danger of his
making one now&mdash;a mistake that might gravely count.&nbsp; He
was resolved only to succeed.&nbsp; It is true that for a great
success he would take a certain risk; but the risk was to be
considered, and he gained time while he multiplied his guesses
and talked about his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may take ten years if you like,&rdquo; said Lady
Beauchemin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no hurry whatever to make
you my brother-in-law.&nbsp; Only you must remember that you
spoke to me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke to me of Barb as the finest girl you had seen
in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m willing to stand by that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he had another try, which would have been transparent to a
compatriot.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess I like her type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you might!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her all round&mdash;with all her
peculiarities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by her peculiarities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she has some peculiar ideas,&rdquo; said Jackson
Lemon in a tone of the sweetest reasonableness, &ldquo;and she
has a peculiar way of speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you can&rsquo;t expect us to speak so well as
you!&rdquo; cried Lady Beauchemin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
perfectly candid.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do some things much
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve our own ways at any rate, and we think them
the best in the world&mdash;as they mostly are!&rdquo; laughed
Lady Beauchemin.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of them&rsquo;s not to let a
gentleman devote himself to a girl for so <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>long a time
without some sense of responsibility.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
wish to marry my sister you ought to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought never to have come,&rdquo; said Jackson
Lemon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely agree to that,&rdquo; her ladyship
good-naturedly replied, &ldquo;as in that case I should have lost
the pleasure of knowing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have spared you this duty, which you dislike
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asking you about your intentions?&nbsp; Oh I
don&rsquo;t dislike it at all!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
amuses me extremely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like your sister to marry me?&rdquo; asked
Jackson with great simplicity.</p>
<p>If he expected to take her by surprise he was disappointed:
she was perfectly prepared to commit herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should like it particularly.&nbsp; I think English and American
society ought to be but one.&nbsp; I mean the best of each.&nbsp;
A great whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to ask whether Lady Marmaduke
suggested that to you?&rdquo; he at once inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve often talked of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, that&rsquo;s her aim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s my aim too.&nbsp; I think
there&rsquo;s a lot to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d like me to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin it, precisely.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think we
ought to see more of each other?&nbsp; I mean,&rdquo; she took
the precaution to explain, &ldquo;just the best in each
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon appeared to weigh it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I haven&rsquo;t any general ideas.&nbsp; If I should marry
an English girl it wouldn&rsquo;t be for the good of the
species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we want to be mixed a little.&nbsp; That
I&rsquo;m sure of,&rdquo; Lady Beauchemin said.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;You certainly got that from Lady
Marmaduke,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too tiresome, your not consenting to be
serious!&nbsp; But my father will make you so,&rdquo; she went on
with her pleasant assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may as well let you
know that he intends in a day or two to ask you your
intentions.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I wished to say to you.&nbsp;
I think you ought to be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&nbsp; Lord Canterville
will do quite right,&rdquo; the young man allowed.</p>
<p>There was to his companion something really unfathomable in
this little American doctor whom she had taken up on grounds of
large policy and who, though he was assumed to have sunk the
medical character, was neither handsome nor distinguished, but
only immensely rich and quite original&mdash;since he
wasn&rsquo;t strictly insignificant.&nbsp; It was unfathomable to
begin with that a medical man should be so rich, or that so rich
a man should be medical; it was even, to an eye always gratified
by suitability and, for that matter, almost everywhere
recognising it, rather irritating.&nbsp; Jackson Lemon himself
could have explained the anomaly better than any one else, but
this was an explanation one could scarcely ask for.&nbsp; There
were other things: his cool acceptance of certain situations; his
general indisposition to make comprehension easy, let alone to
guess it, with all his guessing, so much hindered; his way of
taking refuge in jokes which at times had not even the merit of
being American; his way too of appearing to be a suitor without
being an aspirant.&nbsp; Lady Beauchemin, however, was, like her
puzzling friend himself, prepared to run a certain risk.&nbsp;
His reserves made him slippery, but that was only when one
pressed.&nbsp; She flattered herself she could handle people
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father will be sure to act with perfect
tact,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;though of course if you <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>shouldn&rsquo;t care to be questioned you can go out of
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had the air of really wishing to act with
the most natural delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go out of town; I&rsquo;m
enjoying it far too much here,&rdquo; Jackson cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t your father have a right to ask me what
I should mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Beauchemin thought&mdash;she really wondered.&nbsp; But
in a moment she exclaimed: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s incapable of saying
anything vulgar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t definitely answered his inquiry, and he was
conscious of this; but he was quite ready to say to her a little
later, as he guided her steps from the brougham to the strip of
carpet which, beneath a rickety border of striped cloth and
between a double row of waiting footmen, policemen and dingy
amateurs of both sexes, stretched from the curbstone to the
portal of the Trumpingtons: &ldquo;Of course I shan&rsquo;t wait
for Lord Canterville to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been expecting some such announcement as this from Lady
Beauchemin and really judged her father would do no more than his
duty.&nbsp; He felt he should be prepared with an answer to the
high challenge so prefigured, and he wondered at himself for
still not having come to the point.&nbsp; Sidney Feeder&rsquo;s
question in the Park had made him feel rather pointless; it was
the first direct allusion as yet made to his possible marriage by
any one but Lady Beauchemin.&nbsp; None of his own people were in
London; he was perfectly independent, and even if his mother had
been within reach he couldn&rsquo;t quite have consulted her on
the subject.&nbsp; He loved her dearly, better than any one; but
she wasn&rsquo;t a woman to consult, for she approved of whatever
he did: the fact of his doing it settled the case for it.&nbsp;
He had been careful not to be too serious when he talked with
Lady Barb&rsquo;s relative; but he was very serious <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>indeed as he
thought over the matter within himself, which he did even among
the diversions of the next half-hour, while he squeezed,
obliquely and with tight arrests, through the crush in the
Trumpingtons&rsquo; drawing-room.&nbsp; At the end of the
half-hour he came away, and at the door he found Lady Beauchemin,
from whom he had separated on entering the house and who, this
time with a companion of her own sex, was awaiting her carriage
and still &ldquo;going on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave her his arm to
the street, and as she entered the vehicle she repeated that she
hoped he&rsquo;d just go out of town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then would tell me what to do?&rdquo; he returned,
looking at her through the window.</p>
<p>She might tell him what to do, but he felt free all the same;
and he was determined this should continue.&nbsp; To prove it to
himself he jumped into a hansom and drove back to Brook Street
and to his hotel instead of proceeding to a bright-windowed house
in Portland Place where he knew he should after midnight find
Lady Canterville and her daughters.&nbsp; He recalled a reference
to that chance during his ride with Lady Barb, who would probably
expect him; but it made him taste his liberty not to go, and he
liked to taste his liberty.&nbsp; He was aware that to taste it
in perfection he ought to &ldquo;turn in&rdquo;; but he
didn&rsquo;t turn in, he didn&rsquo;t even take off his
hat.&nbsp; He walked up and down his sitting-room with his head
surmounted by this ornament, a good deal tipped back, and with
his hands in his pockets.&nbsp; There were various cards stuck
into the frame of the mirror over his chimney-piece, and every
time he passed the place he seemed to see what was written on one
of them&mdash;the name of the mistress of the house in Portland
Place, his own name and in the lower left-hand corner &ldquo;A
small Dance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, now, he must make up his
mind; he&rsquo;d make it up by the <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>next day: that was what he said to
himself as he walked up and down; and according to his decision
he&rsquo;d speak to Lord Canterville or would take the
night-express to Paris.&nbsp; It was better meanwhile he
shouldn&rsquo;t see Lady Barb.&nbsp; It was vivid to him, as he
occasionally paused with fevered eyes on the card in the
chimney-glass, that he had come pretty far; and he had come so
far because he was under the spell&mdash;yes, he was under the
spell, or whatever it was, of Lady Barb.&nbsp; There was no doubt
whatever of this; he had a faculty for diagnosis and he knew
perfectly what was the matter with him.&nbsp; He wasted no time
in musing on the mystery of his state; in wondering if he
mightn&rsquo;t have escaped such a seizure by a little vigilance
at first, or if it would abate should he go away.&nbsp; He
accepted it frankly for the sake of the pleasure it gave
him&mdash;the girl was the delight of most of his
senses&mdash;and confined himself to considering how it would
square with his general situation to marry her.&nbsp; The
squaring wouldn&rsquo;t at all necessarily follow from the fact
that he was in love; too many other things would come in
between.&nbsp; The most important of these was the change not
only of the geographical but of the social standpoint for his
wife, and a certain readjustment that it would involve in his own
relation to things.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t inclined to
readjustments, and there was no reason why he should be: his own
position was in most respects so advantageous.&nbsp; But the girl
tempted him almost irresistibly, satisfying his imagination both
as a lover and as a student of the human organism; she was so
blooming, so complete, of a type so rarely encountered in that
degree of perfection.&nbsp; Jackson Lemon was no Anglomaniac, but
he took peculiar pleasure in certain physical facts of the
English&mdash;their complexion, their temperament, their tissue;
and Lady Barb had affected him from the <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>first as in
flexible virginal form a wonderful compendium of these
elements.&nbsp; There was something simple and robust in her
beauty; it had the quietness of an old Greek statue, without the
vulgarity of the modern simper or of contemporary
prettiness.&nbsp; Her head was antique, and though her
conversation was quite of the present period Jackson told himself
that some primitive sincerity of soul couldn&rsquo;t but match
with the cast of her brow, of her bosom, of the back of her neck,
and with the high carriage of her head, which was at once so
noble and so easy.&nbsp; He saw her as she might be in the
future, the beautiful mother of beautiful children in whom the
appearance of &ldquo;race&rdquo; should be conspicuous.&nbsp; He
should like his children to have the appearance of race as well
as other signs of good stuff, and wasn&rsquo;t unaware that he
must take his precautions accordingly.&nbsp; A great many people
in England had these indications, and it was a pleasure to him to
see them, especially as no one had them so unmistakably as the
second daughter of the Cantervilles.&nbsp; It would be a great
luxury to call a creature so constituted one&rsquo;s own; nothing
could be more evident than that, because it made no difference
that she wasn&rsquo;t strikingly clever.&nbsp; Striking
cleverness wasn&rsquo;t one of the signs, nor a mark of the
English complexion in general; it was associated with the modern
simper, which was a result of modern nerves.&nbsp; If Jackson had
wanted a wife all fiddlestrings of course he could have found her
at home; but this tall fair girl, whose character, like her
figure, appeared mainly to have been formed by riding across
country, was differently put together.&nbsp; All the same would
it suit his book, as they said in London, to marry her and
transport her to New York?&nbsp; He came back to this question;
came back to it with a persistency which, had she been admitted
to a view of it, would have tried the patience of Lady <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Beauchemin.&nbsp; She had been irritated more than once
at his appearing to attach himself so exclusively to that horn of
the dilemma&mdash;as if it could possibly fail to be a good thing
for a little American doctor to marry the daughter of an English
peer.&nbsp; It would have been more becoming in her
ladyship&rsquo;s eyes that he should take this for granted a
little more and take the consent of her ladyship&rsquo;s&mdash;of
their ladyships&rsquo;&mdash;family a little less.&nbsp; They
looked at the matter so differently!&nbsp; Jackson Lemon was
conscious that if he should propose for the young woman who so
strongly appealed to him it would be because it suited him, and
not because it suited his possible sisters-in-law.&nbsp; He
believed himself to act in all things by his own faculty of
choice and volition, a feature of his outfit in which he had the
highest confidence.</p>
<p>It would have seemed, indeed, that just now this part of his
inward machine was not working very regularly, since, though he
had come home to go to bed, the stroke of half-past twelve saw
him jump not into his sheets but into a hansom which the whistle
of the porter had summoned to the door of his hotel and in which
he rattled off to Portland Place.&nbsp; Here he found&mdash;in a
very large house&mdash;an assembly of five hundred persons and a
band of music concealed in a bower of azaleas.&nbsp; Lady
Canterville had not arrived; he wandered through the rooms and
assured himself of that.&nbsp; He also discovered a very good
conservatory, where there were banks and pyramids of
azaleas.&nbsp; He watched the top of the staircase, but it was a
long time before he saw what he was looking for, and his
impatience grew at last extreme.&nbsp; The reward, however, when
it came, was all he could have desired.&nbsp; It consisted of a
clear smile from Lady Barb, who stood behind her mother while the
latter extended vague finger-tips to the hostess.&nbsp; The
entrance of <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>this charming woman and her beautiful
daughters&mdash;always a noticeable incident&mdash;was effected
with a certain spread of commotion, and just now it was agreeable
to Jackson to feel this produced impression concern him probably
more than any one else in the house.&nbsp; Tall, dazzling,
indifferent, looking about her as if she saw very little, Lady
Barb was certainly a figure round which a young man&rsquo;s fancy
might revolve.&nbsp; Very rare, yet very quiet and very simple,
she had little manner and little movement; but her detachment was
not a vulgar art.&nbsp; She appeared to efface herself, to wait
till, in the natural course, she should be attended to; and in
this there was evidently no exaggeration, for she was too proud
not to have perfect confidence.&nbsp; Her sister, quite another
affair, with a little surprised smile which seemed to say that in
her extreme innocence she was still prepared for anything, having
heard, indirectly, such extraordinary things about society, was
much more impatient and more expressive, and had always projected
across a threshold the pretty radiance of her eyes and teeth
before her mother&rsquo;s name was announced.&nbsp; Lady
Canterville was by many persons more admired and more championed
than her daughters; she had kept even more beauty than she had
given them, and it was a beauty which had been called
intellectual.&nbsp; She had extraordinary sweetness, without any
definite professions; her manner was mild almost to tenderness;
there was even in it a degree of thoughtful pity, of human
comprehension.&nbsp; Moreover her features were perfect, and
nothing could be more gently gracious than a way she had of
speaking, or rather of listening, to people with her head
inclined a little to one side.&nbsp; Jackson liked her without
trepidation, and she had certainly been &ldquo;awfully
nice&rdquo; to him.&nbsp; He approached Lady Barb as soon as he
could do so without an <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>appearance of rushing up; he remarked
to her that he hoped very much she wouldn&rsquo;t dance.&nbsp; He
was a master of the art which flourishes in New York above every
other, and had guided her through a dozen waltzes with a skill
which, as she felt, left absolutely nothing to be desired.&nbsp;
But dancing was not his business to-night.&nbsp; She smiled
without scorn at the expression of his hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what mamma has brought us here for,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t like it if we don&rsquo;t
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does she know whether she likes it or not?&nbsp;
You always have danced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, once there was a place where I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Lady Barb.</p>
<p>He told her he would at any rate settle it with her mother,
and persuaded her to wander with him into the conservatory, where
coloured lights were suspended among the plants and a vault of
verdure arched above.&nbsp; In comparison with the other rooms
this retreat was far and strange.&nbsp; But they were not alone;
half a-dozen other couples appeared to have had reasons as good
as theirs.&nbsp; The gloom, none the less, was rosy with the
slopes of azalea and suffused with mitigated music, which made it
possible to talk without consideration of one&rsquo;s
neighbours.&nbsp; In spite of this, though it was only in looking
back on the scene later that Lady Barb noted the fact, these
dispersed couples were talking very softly.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t look at them; she seemed to take it that virtually
she was alone with the young American.&nbsp; She said something
about the flowers, about the fragrance of the air; for all answer
to which he asked her, as he stood there before her, a question
that might have startled her by its suddenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do people who marry in England ever know each other
before marriage?&nbsp; They have no chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never was married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very different in my country.&nbsp; There a
man may see much of a girl; he may freely call on her, he may be
constantly alone with her.&nbsp; I wish you allowed that over
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barb began to examine the less ornamental side of her fan
as if it had never invited her before.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be so
very odd, America,&rdquo; she then concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess in that matter we&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;
Over here it&rsquo;s a leap in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she again
made answer.&nbsp; She had folded her fan; she stretched out her
arm mechanically and plucked a sprig of azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t signify after all,&rdquo;
Jackson however proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know they
say that love&rsquo;s blind at the best?&rdquo;&nbsp; His keen
young face was bent upon hers; his thumbs were in the pockets of
his trousers; he smiled with a slight strain, showing his fine
teeth.&nbsp; She said nothing, only pulling her azalea to
pieces.&nbsp; She was usually so quiet that this small movement
was striking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen you in the least
without a lot of people,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very tiresome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sick of it.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want
even to come here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t met his eyes, though she knew they were
seeking her own.&nbsp; But now she looked at him straight.&nbsp;
She had never objected to his appearance, and in this respect had
no repugnance to surmount.&nbsp; She liked a man to be tall and
handsome, and Jackson Lemon was neither; but when she was
sixteen, and as tall herself as she was to be at twenty, she had
been in love&mdash;for three weeks&mdash;with one of her cousins,
a little fellow in the Hussars, who was shorter even <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>than the
American, was of inches markedly fewer than her own.&nbsp; This
proved that distinction might be independent of stature&mdash;not
that she had ever reasoned it out.&nbsp; Doctor Lemon&rsquo;s
facial spareness and his bright ocular attention, which had a
fine edge and a marked scale, unfolded and applied rule-fashion,
affected her as original, and she thought of them as rather
formidable to a good many people, which would do very well in a
husband of hers.&nbsp; As she made this reflexion it of course
never occurred to her that she herself might suffer true
measurement, for she was not a sacrificial lamb.&nbsp; She felt
sure his features expressed a mind&mdash;a mind immensely useful,
like a good hack or whatever, and that he knew how to
employ.&nbsp; She would never have supposed him a doctor; though
indeed when all was said this was very negative and didn&rsquo;t
account for the way he imposed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did you come?&rdquo; she asked in answer to
his last speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it seems to me after all better to see you this
way than not to see you at all.&nbsp; I want to know you
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ought to stay here,&rdquo; she
said as she looked round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go till I&rsquo;ve told you I love
you,&rdquo; the young man distinctly replied.</p>
<p>She made no exclamation, indulged in no start; he
couldn&rsquo;t see even that she changed colour.&nbsp; She took
his request with a noble simplicity, her head erect and her eyes
lowered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve quite a
right to tell me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jackson demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want
to claim the right.&nbsp; I want you to give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve said that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you have a little faith?&rdquo; he at once
asked, <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>speaking as fast as if he were not even a little afraid
to urge the pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will help us to know each
other better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s disgusting, the want of
opportunity; even at Pasterns I could scarcely get a walk with
you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve the most absolute trust of you.&nbsp; I
<i>know</i> I love you, and I couldn&rsquo;t do more than that at
the end of six months.&nbsp; I love your beauty, I love your
nature, I love you from head to foot.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t move,
please don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lowered his tone now,
but it went straight to her ear and we must believe conveyed a
certain eloquence.&nbsp; For himself, after he had heard himself
say these words, all his being was in a glow.&nbsp; It was a
luxury to speak to her of her beauty; it brought him nearer to
her than he had ever been.&nbsp; But the colour had come into her
face and seemed to remind him that her beauty wasn&rsquo;t
all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything about you is true and sweet and
grand,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s dear to
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re good.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what you think of me; I asked Lady Beauchemin to tell me,
and she told me to judge for myself.&nbsp; Well, then, I judge
you like me.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I a right to assume that till
the contrary&rsquo;s proved?&nbsp; May I speak to your
father?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been waiting, but now what should I wait for longer?&nbsp; I want
to be able to tell him you&rsquo;ve given me hope.&nbsp; I
suppose I ought to speak to him first.&nbsp; I meant to,
to-morrow, but meanwhile, to-night, I thought I&rsquo;d just put
this in.&nbsp; In my country it wouldn&rsquo;t matter
particularly.&nbsp; You must see all that over there for
yourself.&nbsp; If you should tell me not to speak to your father
I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;d wait.&nbsp; But I like better to
ask your leave to speak to him than ask his to speak to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice had sunk almost to a whisper, but, though it
trembled, the fact of his pleading gave it intensity.&nbsp; He
had the same attitude, his thumbs in his trousers, his neat
attentive young head, his smile, <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>which was a matter of course; no one
would have imagined what he was saying.&nbsp; She had listened
without moving and at the end she raised her eyes.&nbsp; They
rested on his own a moment, and he remembered for a long time the
look, the clear effluence of splendid maidenhood, as deep as a
surrender, that passed her lids.</p>
<p>Disconcertingly, however, there was no surrender in what she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may say anything you please to my
father, but I don&rsquo;t wish to hear any more.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve said too much, considering how little idea
you&rsquo;ve given me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching you,&rdquo; said Jackson Lemon.</p>
<p>She held her head higher, still looking straight at him.&nbsp;
Then quite seriously, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be
watched,&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be so beautiful then.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you give me a word of hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never supposed I should marry a
foreigner,&rdquo; said Lady Barb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call me a foreigner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your ideas are very different and your country
different.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve told me so yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to show it to you.&nbsp; I would make you
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;d make me do,&rdquo;
she went on very honestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d try,&rdquo; she smiled as
for more accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jackson Lemon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after
all trying now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this she returned that she must go to her mother, and he
was obliged to lead her out of the place.&nbsp; Lady Canterville
was not immediately found, so that he had time to keep it up a
little as they went.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve spoken
I&rsquo;m very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re happy too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say that, Lady Barb,&rdquo; he tenderly
groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I must think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you must!&rdquo; Jackson abundantly
concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to your father
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fancy what he&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he dislike me?&nbsp; But I guess he
doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the young man cried in a tone which Lady
Beauchemin, had she heard him, would have felt connected with his
general retreat upon the quaint.&nbsp; What Lady
Beauchemin&rsquo;s sister thought of it is not recorded; but
there is perhaps a clue to her opinion in the answer she made him
after a moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;Really, you know, you
<i>are</i> a foreigner!&rdquo;&nbsp; With this she turned her
back, for she was already in her mother&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
Jackson Lemon said a few words to Lady Canterville; they were
chiefly about its being very hot.&nbsp; She gave him her vague
sweet attention, as if he were saying something ingenious but of
which she missed the point.&nbsp; He could see she was thinking
of the ways of her daughter Agatha, whose attitude toward the
contemporary young man was wanting in the perception of
differences&mdash;a madness too much without method; she was
evidently not occupied with Lady Barb, who was more to be
depended on.&nbsp; This young woman never met her suitor&rsquo;s
eyes again; she let her own rest rather ostentatiously on other
objects.&nbsp; At last he was going away without a glance from
her.&nbsp; Her mother had asked him to luncheon for the morrow,
and he had said he would come if she would promise him he should
see his lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay you another
visit till I&rsquo;ve had some talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not, but if I speak to him I
daresay he will be at home,&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be worth his while!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this he
almost <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>committed himself; and he left the house reflecting that
as he had never proposed to a girl before he couldn&rsquo;t be
expected to know how women demean themselves in this
emergency.&nbsp; He had heard indeed that Lady Barb had had no
end of offers; and though he supposed the number probably
overstated, as it always is, he had to infer that her way of
appearing suddenly to have dropped him was but the usual
behaviour for the occasion.</p>
<h3><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>III</h3>
<p>At her mother&rsquo;s the next day she was absent from
luncheon, and Lady Canterville mentioned to him&mdash;he
didn&rsquo;t ask&mdash;that she had gone to see a dear old
great-aunt who was also her godmother and who lived at
Roehampton.&nbsp; Lord Canterville was not present, but Jackson
learned from his hostess that he had promised her he would come
in exactly at three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Our young man lunched
with her ladyship and the children, who appeared in force at this
repast, all the younger girls being present, and two little boys,
the juniors of the two sons who were in their teens.&nbsp; Doctor
Lemon, who was fond of children and thought these absolutely the
finest in the world&mdash;magnificent specimens of a magnificent
brood, such as it would be so satisfactory in future days to see
about his own knee&mdash;Doctor Lemon felt himself treated as one
of the family, but was not frightened by what he read into the
privilege of his admission.&nbsp; Lady Canterville showed no
sense whatever of his having mooted the question of becoming her
son-in-law, and he believed the absent object of his attentions
hadn&rsquo;t told her of their evening&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; This
idea gave him pleasure; he liked to think Lady Barb was judging
him for herself.&nbsp; Perhaps indeed she was taking counsel of
the old lady at Roehampton: he saw himself the sort of lover of
whom a godmother would approve.&nbsp; Godmothers, in <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>his mind,
were mainly associated with fairy-tales&mdash;he had had no
baptismal sponsors of his own; and that point of view would be
favourable to a young man with a great deal of gold who had
suddenly arrived from a foreign country&mdash;an apparition
surely in a proper degree elfish.&nbsp; He made up his mind he
should like Lady Canterville as a mother-in-law; she would be too
well-bred to meddle.&nbsp; Her husband came in at three
o&rsquo;clock, just after they had risen, and observed that it
was very good in him to have waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t waited,&rdquo; Jackson replied with his
watch in his hand; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re punctual to the
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know not how Lord Canterville may have judged his young
friend, but Jackson Lemon had been told more than once in his
life that he would have been all right if he hadn&rsquo;t been so
literal.&nbsp; After he had lighted a cigarette in his
lordship&rsquo;s &ldquo;den,&rdquo; a large brown apartment on
the ground-floor, which partook at once of the nature of an
office and of that of a harness-room&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t have
been called in any degree a library or even a study&mdash;he went
straight to the point in these terms: &ldquo;Well now, Lord
Canterville, I feel I ought to let you know without more delay
that I&rsquo;m in love with Lady Barb and that I should like to
make her my wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he spoke, puffing his
cigarette, with his conscious but unextenuating eyes fixed on his
host.</p>
<p>No man, as I have intimated, bore better being looked at than
this noble personage; he seemed to bloom in the envious warmth of
human contemplation and never appeared so faultless as when most
exposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he
murmured almost in disparagement, stroking his ambrosial beard
from before the empty fireplace.&nbsp; He lifted his eyebrows,
but looked perfectly good-natured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you surprised, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jackson asked.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Why I suppose a fellow&rsquo;s surprised at any
one&rsquo;s wanting one of his children.&nbsp; He sometimes feels
the weight of that sort of thing so much, you know.&nbsp; He
wonders what use on earth another man can make of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lord Canterville laughed pleasantly
through the copious fringe of his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want one of them,&rdquo; said his guest,
laughing too, but with a lighter organ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polygamy would be rather good for the parents.&nbsp;
However, Luke told me the other night she knew you to be looking
the way you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mentioned to Lady Beauchemin that I love Lady
Barb, and she seemed to think it natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I suppose there&rsquo;s no want of nature in
it!&nbsp; But, my dear fellow, I really don&rsquo;t know what to
say,&rdquo; his lordship added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll have to think of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In saying which Jackson felt himself make the
most liberal concession to the point of view of his interlocutor;
being perfectly aware that in his own country it wasn&rsquo;t
left much to the parents to think of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to talk it over with my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lady Canterville has been very kind to me; I hope
she&rsquo;ll continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Canterville passed a large fair hand, as for inspiration,
over his beard.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow, we&rsquo;re
excellent friends.&nbsp; No one could appreciate you more than
Lady Canterville.&nbsp; Of course we can only consider such a
question on the&mdash;a&mdash;the highest grounds.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d never want to marry without knowing&mdash;as it
were&mdash;exactly what you&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp; I, on my side,
naturally, you know, am bound to do the best I can for my own
poor child.&nbsp; At the same time, of course, we don&rsquo;t
want to spend our time in&mdash;a&mdash;walking round the
horse.&nbsp; We want to get at the truth about him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was settled between them after a little that the truth about
Lemon&rsquo;s business <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>was that he knew to a certainty the
state of his affections and was in a position to pretend to the
hand of a young lady who, Lord Canterville might say without
undue swagger, had a right to expect to do as well as any girl
about the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she had,&rdquo; Doctor Lemon said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very rare type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His entertainer had a pleasant blank look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a clever well-grown girl and she takes her
fences like a grasshopper.&nbsp; Does she know all this, by the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I told her last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Lord Canterville had the air, unusual with him, of
sounding, at some expense of precious moments, the expression of
face of a visitor so unacquainted with shyness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you ought to have done that, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have spoken to you first&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jackson Lemon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I meant
to; but it stuck in my crop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t in your country, I guess,&rdquo; his
lordship amicably laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not as a general thing.&nbsp; However, I find it
very pleasant to have the whole thing out with you
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in truth it was very pleasant.&nbsp;
Nothing could be easier, friendlier, more informal, than Lord
Canterville&rsquo;s manner, which implied all sorts of equality,
especially that of age and fortune, and made our young man feel
at the end of three minutes almost as if he too were a
beautifully-preserved and somewhat straitened nobleman of sixty,
with the views of a man of the world about his own
marriage.&nbsp; Jackson perceived that Lord Canterville waived
the point of his having spoken first to the girl herself, and saw
in this indulgence a just concession to the ardour of young
affection.&nbsp; For his lordship seemed perfectly to appreciate
the sentimental side&mdash;at least so far as it was embodied in
his visitor&mdash;when he said <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>without deprecation: &ldquo;Did she
give you any encouragement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t box my ears.&nbsp; She told me
she&rsquo;d think of it, but that I must speak to you.&nbsp;
Naturally, however, I shouldn&rsquo;t have said what I did if I
hadn&rsquo;t made up my mind during the last fortnight that
I&rsquo;m not disagreeable to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear young man, women are odd fish!&rdquo; this
parent exclaimed rather unexpectedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of course
you know all that,&rdquo; he added in an instant; &ldquo;you take
the general risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to take the general
risk.&nbsp; The particular risk strikes me as small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my honour I don&rsquo;t really know my
girls.&nbsp; You see a man&rsquo;s time in England is
tremendously taken up; but I daresay it&rsquo;s the same in your
country.&nbsp; Their mother knows them&mdash;I think I had better
send for their mother.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Lord
Canterville wound up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just suggest that she
join us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather afraid of you both together, but if it
will settle it any quicker&mdash;!&rdquo; Jackson said.&nbsp; His
companion rang the bell and, when a servant appeared, despatched
him with a message to her ladyship.&nbsp; While they were waiting
the young man remembered how easily he could give a more definite
account of his pecuniary basis.&nbsp; He had simply stated before
that he was abundantly able to marry; he shrank from putting
himself forward as a monster of money.&nbsp; With his excellent
taste he wished to appeal to Lord Canterville primarily as a
gentleman.&nbsp; But now that he had to make a double impression
he bethought himself of his millions, for millions were always
impressive.&nbsp; &ldquo;It strikes me as only fair to let you
know that my fortune&rsquo;s really considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I daresay you&rsquo;re beastly rich,&rdquo; said
Lord Canterville with a natural and visible faith.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Well, I represent, all told, some seven
millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven millions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I count in dollars.&nbsp; Upwards of a million and a
half sterling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Canterville looked at him from head to foot, exhaling
with great promptitude an air of cheerful resignation to a form
of grossness threatening to become common.&nbsp; Then he said
with a touch of that inconsequence of which he had already given
a glimpse: &ldquo;What the deuce in that case possessed you to
turn doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon coloured a little and demurred, but bethought
himself of his best of reasons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my having
simply the talent for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t for a moment doubt your
ability.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; his lordship candidly
asked, &ldquo;find it rather a bore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t practise much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rather
ashamed to say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, of course in your country it&rsquo;s
different.&nbsp; I daresay you&rsquo;ve got a door-plate,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, and a tin sign tied to the balcony!&rdquo;
Jackson laughed.</p>
<p>Here the joke was beyond his friend, who but went on:
&ldquo;What on earth did your father say to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my going into medicine?&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d be
hanged if he&rsquo;d take any of my doses.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
think I should succeed; he wanted me to go into the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the House&mdash;a&mdash;?&rdquo; Lord Canterville
just wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would be into your
Congress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no, not so bad as that.&nbsp; Into the store,&rdquo;
Jackson returned with that refinement of the ingenuous which he
reserved for extreme cases.</p>
<p>His host stared, not venturing even for the moment to hazard
an interpretation; and before a solution <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>had presented
itself Lady Canterville was on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I thought we had better see you.&nbsp; Do you
know he wants to marry our second girl?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in
these simple and lucid terms that her husband acquainted her with
the question.</p>
<p>She expressed neither surprise nor elation; she simply stood
there smiling, her head a little inclined to the side and her
beautiful benevolence well to the front.&nbsp; Her charming eyes
rested on Doctor Lemon&rsquo;s; and, though they showed a shade
of anxiety for a matter of such importance, his own discovered in
them none of the coldness of calculation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
talking about dear Barb?&rdquo; she asked in a moment and as if
her thoughts had been far away.</p>
<p>Of course they were talking about dear Barb, and Jackson
repeated to her what he had said to her noble spouse.&nbsp; He
had thought it all over and his mind was quite made up.&nbsp;
Moreover, he had spoken to the young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you that, my dear?&rdquo; his lordship
asked while he lighted another cigar.</p>
<p>She gave no heed to this inquiry, which had been vague and
accidental on the speaker&rsquo;s part; she simply remarked to
their visitor that the thing was very serious and that they had
better sit down a moment.&nbsp; In an instant he was near her on
the sofa on which she had placed herself and whence she still
smiled up at her husband with her air of luxurious patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barb has told me nothing,&rdquo; she dropped, however,
after a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves how much she cares for me!&rdquo; Jackson
declared with instant lucidity.</p>
<p>Lady Canterville looked as if she thought this really too
ingenious, almost as professional as if their talk were a
consultation; but her husband went, all <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>gaily,
straighter to the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah well, if she cares for
you I don&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a little ambiguous; but before the young man had time
to look into it his hostess put a bland question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Should you expect her to live in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my home, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be living sometimes in
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;we&rsquo;ll come over and see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was in love, he wanted to marry, he wanted
to be genial and to commend himself to the family; yet it was in
his nature not to accept conditions save in so far as they met
his taste, not to tie himself or, as they said in New York, give
himself away.&nbsp; He preferred in any transaction his own terms
to those of any one else, so that the moment Lady Canterville
gave signs of wishing to extract a promise he was on his
guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find it very different; perhaps she
won&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; her ladyship suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she likes me she&rsquo;ll like my country,&rdquo;
Jackson Lemon returned with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tells me he has a plate on his door,&rdquo; Lord
Canterville put in for the right pleasant tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must talk to her of course; we must understand how
she feels&rdquo;&mdash;and his wife looked, though still
gracious, more nobly responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t discourage her, Lady
Canterville,&rdquo; Jackson firmly said; &ldquo;and give me a
chance to talk to her a little more myself.&nbsp; You
haven&rsquo;t given me much chance, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t offer our daughters to people, however
amiable, Mr. Lemon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her charming grand manner rather
quickened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t like some women in London, you
know,&rdquo; Lord Canterville helpfully explained; &ldquo;you see
we rather stave off the evil day: we like to be <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>together.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Jackson certainly, if the
idea had been presented to him, would have said that No,
decidedly, Lady Barb hadn&rsquo;t been thrown at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he declared in answer to her
mother&rsquo;s remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you know you
mustn&rsquo;t decline overtures too much either; you
mustn&rsquo;t make a poor fellow wait too long.&nbsp; I admire
her, I love her, more than I can say; I give you my word of
honour for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to think that settles it,&rdquo; said Lord
Canterville, shining richly down at the young American from his
place before the cold chimney-piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly that&rsquo;s what we desire, Philip,&rdquo;
her ladyship returned with an equal grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Barb believes it; I&rsquo;m sure she does!&rdquo;
Jackson exclaimed with spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I pretend
to be in love with her if I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Canterville received this appeal in silence, and her
husband, with just the least air in the world of repressed
impatience, began to walk up and down the room.&nbsp; He was a
man of many engagements, and he had been closeted for more than a
quarter of an hour with the young American doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you imagine you should come often to England?&rdquo;
Lady Canterville asked as if to think of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t tell you that; of course
we shall do whatever seems best.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was prepared to
suppose they should cross the Atlantic every summer&mdash;that
prospect was by no means displeasing to him; but he wasn&rsquo;t
prepared to tie himself, as he would have said, up to it, nor up
to anything in particular.&nbsp; It was in his mind not as an
overt pretension but as a tacit implication that he should treat
with the parents of his presumed bride on a footing of perfect
equality; and there would somehow be nothing equal if he should
begin to enter into engagements that didn&rsquo;t belong to the
essence of the matter.&nbsp; They were to <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>give their
daughter and he was to take her: in this arrangement there would
be as much on one side as on the other.&nbsp; But beyond it he
had nothing to ask of them; there was nothing he was calling on
them to promise, and his own pledges therefore would have no
equivalent.&nbsp; Whenever his wife should wish it she should
come over and see her people.&nbsp; Her home was to be in New
York; but he was tacitly conscious that on the question of
absences he should be very liberal, and there was meanwhile
something in the very grain of his character that forbade he
should be eagerly yielding about times and dates.</p>
<p>Lady Canterville looked at her spouse, but he was now not
attentive; he was taking a peep at his watch.&nbsp; In a moment,
however, he threw out a remark to the effect that he thought it a
capital thing the two countries should become more united, and
there was nothing that would bring it about better than a few of
the best people on both sides pairing-off together.&nbsp; The
English indeed had begun it; a lot of fellows had brought over a
lot of pretty girls, and it was quite fair play that the
Americans should take their pick.&nbsp; They were all one race,
after all; and why shouldn&rsquo;t they make one
society&mdash;the best of both sides, of course?&nbsp; Jackson
Lemon smiled as he recognised Lady Marmaduke&rsquo;s great
doctrine, and he was pleased to think Lady Beauchemin had some
influence with her father; for he was sure the great old boy, as
he mentally designated his host, had got all this from her,
though he expressed himself less happily than the cleverest of
his daughters.&nbsp; Our hero had no objection to make to it,
especially if there were aught in it that would really help his
case.&nbsp; But it was not in the least on these high grounds he
had sought the hand of Lady Barb.&nbsp; He wanted her not in
order that her people and his&mdash;the best on both
sides!&mdash;should make one society; he wanted her <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>simply
because he wanted her.&nbsp; Lady Canterville smiled, but she
seemed to have another thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite appreciate what my husband says, but I
don&rsquo;t see why poor Barb should be the one to
begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay she&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; said his
lordship as if he were attempting a short cut.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
say you spoil your women awfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not one of their women yet,&rdquo; Lady
Canterville remarked in the sweetest tone in the world; and then
she added without Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s knowing exactly what she
meant: &ldquo;It seems so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was slightly irritated, and these vague words perhaps added
to the feeling.&nbsp; There had been no positive opposition to
his suit, and both his entertainers were most kind; but he felt
them hold back a little, and though he hadn&rsquo;t expected them
to throw themselves on his neck he was rather
disappointed&mdash;his pride was touched.&nbsp; Why should they
hesitate?&nbsp; He knew himself such a good <i>parti</i>.&nbsp;
It was not so much his noble host&mdash;it was Lady
Canterville.&nbsp; As he saw her lord and master look covertly
and a second time at his watch he could have believed him glad to
settle the matter on the spot.&nbsp; Lady Canterville seemed to
wish their aspirant to come forward more, to give certain
assurances and pledges.&nbsp; He felt he was ready to say or do
anything that was a matter of proper form, but he couldn&rsquo;t
take the tone of trying to purchase her ladyship&rsquo;s assent,
penetrated as he was with the conviction that such a man as he
could be trusted to care for his wife rather more than an
impecunious British peer and <i>his</i> wife could be
supposed&mdash;with the lights he had acquired on English
society&mdash;to care even for the handsomest of a dozen
children.&nbsp; It was a mistake on the old lady&rsquo;s part not
to recognise that.&nbsp; He humoured this to the extent of saying
just a little dryly: &ldquo;My wife shall certainly have
everything she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;He tells me he&rsquo;s disgustingly rich,&rdquo;
Lord Canterville added, pausing before their companion with his
hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it; but it isn&rsquo;t so much
that,&rdquo; she made answer, sinking back a little on her
sofa.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t say what it
was, though she had looked for a moment as if she were going
to.&nbsp; She only raised her eyes to her husband&rsquo;s face,
she asked for inspiration.&nbsp; I know not whether she found it,
but in a moment she said to Jackson Lemon, seeming to imply that
it was quite another point: &ldquo;Do you expect to continue your
profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no such intention, so far as his profession meant
getting up at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning to assuage the
ills of humanity; but here, as before, the touch of such a
question instantly stiffened him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my
profession!&nbsp; I rather wince at that grand old name.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve neglected my work so scandalously that I scarce know
on what terms with it I shall be&mdash;though hoping for the best
when once I&rsquo;m right there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Canterville received these remarks in silence, fixing her
eyes once more upon her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But his
countenance really rather failed her; still with his hands in his
pockets, save when he needed to remove his cigar from his lips,
he went and looked out of the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course we
know you don&rsquo;t practise, and when you&rsquo;re a married
man you&rsquo;ll have less time even than now.&nbsp; But I should
really like to know if they call you Doctor over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, universally.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re almost as fond
of titles as your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that a title,&rdquo; her ladyship
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so good as duke or marquis, I admit; but
we have to take what we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bother, what does it signify?&rdquo; his lordship
demanded from his place at the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>to have a
horse named Doctor, and a jolly good one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call bishops Doctors?&nbsp; Well, then,
call me Bishop!&rdquo; Jackson laughed.</p>
<p>Lady Canterville visibly didn&rsquo;t follow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care for <i>any</i> titles,&rdquo; she nevertheless
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a gentleman
shouldn&rsquo;t be called Mr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It suddenly appeared to her young friend that there was
something helpless, confused and even slightly comical in her
state.&nbsp; The impression was mollifying, and he too, like Lord
Canterville, had begun to long for a short cut.&nbsp; He relaxed
a moment and, leaning toward his hostess with a smile and his
hands on his little knees, he said softly: &ldquo;It seems to me
a question of no importance.&nbsp; All I desire is that you
should call me your son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand and he pressed it almost
affectionately.&nbsp; Then she got up, remarking that before
anything was decided she must see her child, must learn from her
own lips the state of her feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like at all her not having spoken to me already,&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has she gone&mdash;to Roehampton?&nbsp; I daresay
she has told it all to her godmother,&rdquo; said Lord
Canterville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t have much to tell, poor girl!&rdquo;
Jackson freely commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must really insist on
seeing with more freedom the person I wish to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have all the freedom you want in two or three
days,&rdquo; said Lady Canterville.&nbsp; She irradiated all her
charity; she appeared to have accepted him and yet still to be
making tacit assumptions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there certain
things to be talked of first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain things, dear lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her husband, and though he was still at his
window he felt it this time in her silence and <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>had to come
away and speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh she means settlements and that
kind of thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was an allusion that came with a
much better grace from the father.</p>
<p>Jackson turned from one of his companions to the other; he
coloured a little and his self-control was perhaps a trifle
strained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Settlements?&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t make
them in my country.&nbsp; You may be sure I shall make a proper
provision for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, over here&mdash;in our class, you
know&mdash;it&rsquo;s the custom,&rdquo; said Lord Canterville
with a truer ease in his face at the thought that the discussion
was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my own ideas,&rdquo; Jackson returned with
even greater confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me it&rsquo;s a question for the solicitors
to discuss,&rdquo; Lady Canterville suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may discuss it as much as they
please&rdquo;&mdash;the young man showed amusement.&nbsp; He
thought he saw his solicitors discussing it!&nbsp; He had indeed
his own ideas.&nbsp; He opened the door for his hostess and the
three passed out of the room together, walking into the hall in a
silence that expressed a considerable awkwardness.&nbsp; A note
had been struck which grated and scratched a little.&nbsp; A pair
of shining footmen, at their approach, rose from a bench to a
great altitude and stood there like sentinels presenting
arms.&nbsp; Jackson stopped, looking for a moment into the
interior of his hat, which he had in his hand.&nbsp; Then raising
his keen eyes he fixed them a moment on those of Lady
Canterville, addressing her instinctively rather than his other
critic.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess you and Lord Canterville had better
leave it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have our traditions, Mr. Lemon,&rdquo; said her
ladyship with a firm grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine you
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;!&rdquo; she gravely breathed.</p>
<p>Lord Canterville laid his hand on their visitor&rsquo;s <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear boy, those fellows will
settle it in three minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely they will!&rdquo; said Jackson Lemon.&nbsp;
Then he asked of Lady Canterville when he might see Lady
Barb.</p>
<p>She turned it spaciously over.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write
you a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the tall footmen at the end of the impressive vista had
opened wide the portals, as if even he were aware of the dignity
to which the small strange gentleman had virtually been
raised.&nbsp; But Jackson lingered; he was visibly unsatisfied,
though apparently so little conscious he was unsatisfying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ideas are certainly different,&rdquo; said Lady
Canterville.</p>
<p>His lordship, however, made comparatively light of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the girl understands you that&rsquo;s
enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t <i>she</i> write to me?&rdquo; Jackson
asked of her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly must write to her,
you know, if you won&rsquo;t let me see her.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you may write to her, Mr. Lemon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a point, for a moment, in the look he returned on
this, while he said to himself that if necessary he would
transmit his appeal through the old lady at Roehampton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right&mdash;good-bye.&nbsp; You know what I want at
any rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as he was going he turned and added:
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid I won&rsquo;t always bring her
over in the hot weather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hot weather?&rdquo; Lady Canterville murmured
with vague visions of the torrid zone.&nbsp; Jackson however
quitted the house with the sense he had made great
concessions.</p>
<p>His host and hostess passed into a small morning-room
and&mdash;Lord Canterville having taken up his hat and stick to
go out again&mdash;stood there a moment, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>face to
face.&nbsp; Then his lordship spoke in a summary manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear enough he wants her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something so odd about him,&rdquo; Lady
Canterville answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy his speaking so about
settlements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better give him his head.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll go
much quieter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so obstinate&mdash;very obstinate;
it&rsquo;s easy to see that.&nbsp; And he seems to think,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;that a girl in your daughter&rsquo;s position
can be married from one day to the other&mdash;with a ring and a
new frock&mdash;like a housemaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that, of course, over there is the kind of
thing.&nbsp; But he seems really to have a most extraordinary
fortune, and every one does say they give their women <i>carte
blanche</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carte blanche</i> is not what Barb wants; she wants
a settlement.&nbsp; She wants a definite income,&rdquo; said Lady
Canterville; &ldquo;she wants to be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her rather straight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has she told
you so?&nbsp; I thought you said&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t explain her inconsequence; she only remarked
that American fortunes were notoriously insecure; one heard of
nothing else; they melted away like smoke.&nbsp; It was their own
duty to their child to demand that something should be fixed.</p>
<p>Well, he met this in his way.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has a million
and a half sterling.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make out what he does
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to it without a flutter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our child
should have, then, something very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, my dear; but you must manage it; you must
consider it; you must send for Hardman.&nbsp; Only take care you
don&rsquo;t put him off; it may be a very good opening, you
know.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a great deal to be done out there; I
believe in all that,&rdquo; Lord <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Canterville went on in the tone of a
conscientious parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that he <i>is</i> a
doctor&mdash;in some awful place,&rdquo; his wife brooded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a pedlar for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they should go out I think Agatha might go with
them,&rdquo; her ladyship continued in the same tone, but a
little disconnectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may send them all out if you like.&nbsp;
Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair embraced, but her hand detained him a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s greatly in
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he&rsquo;s very bad&mdash;but he&rsquo;s a
sharp little beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly quite likes him,&rdquo; Lady Canterville
stated rather formally as they separated.</p>
<h3><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>IV</h3>
<p>Jackson Lemon had said to Dr. Feeder in the Park that he would
call on Mr. and Mrs. Freer; but three weeks were to elapse before
he knocked at their door in Jermyn Street.&nbsp; In the meantime
he had met them at dinner and Mrs. Freer had told him how much
she hoped he would find time to come and see her.&nbsp; She had
not reproached him nor shaken her finger at him, and her
clemency, which was calculated and very characteristic of her,
touched him so much&mdash;for he was in fault, she was one of his
mother&rsquo;s oldest and best friends&mdash;that he very soon
presented himself.&nbsp; It was on a fine Sunday afternoon,
rather late, and the region of Jermyn Street looked forsaken and
inanimate; the native dulness of the brick scenery reigned
undisputed.&nbsp; Mrs. Freer, however, was at home, resting on a
lodging-house sofa&mdash;an angular couch draped in faded
chintz&mdash;before she went to dress for dinner.&nbsp; She made
the young man very welcome; she told him again how much she had
been thinking of him; she had longed so for a chance to talk with
him.&nbsp; He immediately guessed what she had in her mind, and
he then remembered that Sidney Feeder had named to him what it
was this pair took upon themselves to say.&nbsp; This had
provoked him at the time, but he had forgotten it afterward;
partly because he became aware that same night of his wanting to
make the &ldquo;young marchioness&rdquo; his own <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and partly
because since then he had suffered much greater annoyance.&nbsp;
Yes, the poor young man, so conscious of liberal intentions, of a
large way of looking at the future, had had much to irritate and
disgust him.&nbsp; He had seen the mistress of his affections but
three or four times, and had received a letter from Mr. Hardman,
Lord Canterville&rsquo;s solicitor, asking him, in terms the most
obsequious it was true, to designate some gentleman of the law
with whom the preliminaries of his marriage to Lady Barbarina
Clement might be arranged.&nbsp; He had given Mr. Hardman the
name of such a functionary, but he had written by the same post
to his own solicitor&mdash;for whose services in other matters he
had had much occasion, Jackson Lemon being distinctly
contentious&mdash;instructing him that he was at liberty to meet
that gentleman, but not at liberty to entertain any proposals as
to the odious English idea of a settlement.&nbsp; If marrying
Jackson Lemon wasn&rsquo;t settlement enough the house of
Canterville had but to alter their point of view.&nbsp; It was
quite out of the question he should alter his.&nbsp; It would
perhaps be difficult to explain the strong dislike he entertained
to the introduction into his prospective union of this harsh
diplomatic element; it was as if they mistrusted him and
suspected him; as if his hands were to be tied so that he
shouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle his own fortune as he thought
best.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the idea of parting with his money
that displeased him, for he flattered himself he had plans of
expenditure for his wife beyond even the imagination of her
distinguished parents.&nbsp; It struck him even that they were
fools not to have felt subtly sure they should make a much better
thing of it by leaving him perfectly free.&nbsp; This
intervention of the solicitor was a nasty little English
tradition&mdash;totally at variance with the large spirit of
American habits&mdash;to which he wouldn&rsquo;t submit.&nbsp; <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>It
wasn&rsquo;t his way to submit when he disapproved: why should he
change his way on this occasion when the matter lay so near
him?</p>
<p>These reflexions and a hundred more had flowed freely through
his mind for several days before his call in Jermyn Street, and
they had engendered a lively indignation and a bitter sense of
wrong.&nbsp; They had even introduced, as may be imagined, a
certain awkwardness into his relations with the house of
Canterville, of which indeed it may be said that these amenities
were for the moment virtually suspended.&nbsp; His first
interview with Lady Barb after his conference with the old
couple, as he called her august elders, had been as frank, had
been as sweet, as he could have desired.&nbsp; Lady Canterville
had at the end of three days sent him an invitation&mdash;five
words on a card&mdash;asking him to dine with them on the morrow
quite <i>en famille</i>.&nbsp; This had been the only formal
intimation that his engagement to her daughter was recognised;
for even at the family banquet, which included half a dozen
guests of pleasant address but vague affiliation, there had been
no reference on the part either of his host or his hostess to the
subject of their converse in Lord Canterville&rsquo;s den.&nbsp;
The only allusion was a wandering ray, once or twice, in Lady
Barb&rsquo;s own fine eyes.&nbsp; When, however, after dinner,
she strolled away with him into the music-room, which was lighted
and empty, to play for him something out of &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo;
of which he had spoken at table, and when the young couple were
allowed to enjoy for upwards of an hour, unmolested, the
comparative privacy of that elegant refuge, he felt Lady
Canterville definitely to count on him.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
believe in any serious difficulties.&nbsp; Neither did he then;
and that was why it was not to be condoned that there should be a
vain appearance of them.&nbsp; The arrangements, he supposed her
ladyship would have <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>said, were pending, and indeed they were; for he had
already given orders in Bond Street for the setting of an
extraordinary number of diamonds.&nbsp; Lady Barb, at any rate,
during that hour he spent with her, had had nothing to say about
arrangements; and it had been an hour of pure satisfaction.&nbsp;
She had seated herself at the piano and had played perpetually,
in a soft incoherent manner, while he leaned over the instrument,
very close to her, and said everything that came into his
head.&nbsp; She was braver and handsomer than ever and looked at
him as if she liked him out and out.</p>
<p>This was all he expected of her, for it didn&rsquo;t belong to
the cast of her beauty to betray a vulgar infatuation.&nbsp; That
beauty was clearly all he had believed it from the first, and
with something now thrown in, something ever so touching and
stirring, which seemed to stamp her from that moment as his
precious possession.&nbsp; He felt more than ever her intimate
value and the great social outlay it had taken to produce such a
mixture.&nbsp; Simple and girlish as she was, and not
particularly quick in the give and take of conversation, she
seemed to him to have a part of the history of England in her
blood; she was the fine flower of generations of privileged
people and of centuries of rich country-life.&nbsp; Between these
two of course was no glance at the question which had been put
into the hands of Mr. Hardman, and the last thing that occurred
to Jackson was that Lady Barb had views as to his settling a
fortune upon her before their marriage.&nbsp; It may appear odd,
but he hadn&rsquo;t asked himself whether his money operated on
her in any degree as a bribe; and this was because,
instinctively, he felt such a speculation idle&mdash;the point
was essentially not to be ascertained&mdash;and because he was
quite ready to take it for agreeable to her to continue to live
in luxury.&nbsp; It was eminently <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>agreeable to him to have means to
enable her to do so.&nbsp; He was acquainted with the mingled
character of human motives and glad he was rich enough to pretend
to the hand of a young woman who, for the best of reasons, would
be very expensive.&nbsp; After the good passage in the music-room
he had ridden with her twice, but hadn&rsquo;t found her
otherwise accessible.&nbsp; She had let him know the second time
they rode that Lady Canterville had directed her to make, for the
moment, no further appointment with him; and on his presenting
himself more than once at the house he had been told that neither
the mother nor the daughter was at home: it had been added that
Lady Barb was staying at Roehampton.&nbsp; In touching on that
restriction she had launched at him just a distinguishable mute
reproach&mdash;there was always a certain superior dumbness in
her eyes&mdash;as if he were exposing her to an annoyance she
ought to be spared, or taking an eccentric line on a question
that all well-bred people treated in the conventional way.</p>
<p>His induction from this was not that she wished to be secure
about his money, but that, like a dutiful English daughter, she
received her opinions&mdash;on points that were indifferent to
her&mdash;ready-made from a mamma whose fallibility had never
been exposed.&nbsp; He knew by this that his solicitor had
answered Mr. Hardman&rsquo;s letter and that Lady
Canterville&rsquo;s coolness was the fruit of the
correspondence.&nbsp; The effect of it was not in the least to
make him come round, as he phrased it; he had not the smallest
intention of doing that.&nbsp; Lady Canterville had spoken of the
traditions of her family; but he had no need to go to his family
for his own.&nbsp; They resided within himself; anything he had
once undiscussably made up his mind to acquired in three minutes
the force, and with that the due dignity of a tradition.&nbsp;
Meanwhile he was in the detestable position of not knowing <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>whether or no
he were engaged.&nbsp; He wrote to Lady Barb to clear it up, to
smooth it down&mdash;it being so strange she shouldn&rsquo;t
receive him; and she addressed him in return a very pretty little
letter, which had to his mind a fine by-gone quality, an
old-fashioned, a last-century freshness that might have flowed, a
little thinly, from the pen of Clarissa or Sophia.&nbsp; She
professed that she didn&rsquo;t in the least understand the
situation; that of course she would never give him up; that her
mother had said there were the best reasons for their not going
too fast; that, thank God, she was yet young and could wait as
long as he would; but that she begged he wouldn&rsquo;t write her
about money-matters: she had never been able to count even on her
fingers.&nbsp; He felt in no danger whatever of making this last
mistake; he only noted how Lady Barb thought it natural there
should be a discussion; and this made it vivid to him afresh that
he had got hold of a daughter of the Crusaders.&nbsp; His
ingenious mind could appreciate this hereditary assumption at the
very same time that, to light his own footsteps, it remained
entirely modern.&nbsp; He believed&mdash;or he thought he
believed&mdash;that in the end he should marry his gorgeous girl
on his own terms; but in the interval there was a sensible
indignity in being challenged and checked.&nbsp; One effect of it
indeed was to make him desire the young woman more
intensely.&nbsp; When she wasn&rsquo;t before his eyes in the
flesh she hovered before him as an image, and this image had
reasons of its own for making him at hours fairly languid with
love.</p>
<p>There were moments, however, when he wearied of the mere
enshrined memory&mdash;it was too impalpable and too
thankless.&nbsp; Then it befell that Jackson Lemon for the first
time in his life dropped and gave way&mdash;gave way, that is, to
the sense of sadness.&nbsp; He felt alone in London, and very
much out of it, <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>in spite of all the acquaintances he had made and the
bills he had paid; he felt the need of a greater intimacy than
any he had formed&mdash;save of course in the case of Lady
Barb.&nbsp; He wanted to vent his disgust, to relieve himself,
from the New York point of view.&nbsp; He felt that in engaging
in a contest with the great house of Canterville he was after all
rather single.&nbsp; That singleness was of course in a great
measure an inspiration; but it pinched him hard at moments.&nbsp;
Then it would have pleased him could his mother have been near;
he used to talk of his affairs a great deal with this delightful
parent, who had a delicate way of advising him in the sense he
liked best.&nbsp; He had even gone so far as to wish he had never
laid eyes on Lady Barb, but had fallen in love instead with some
one or other of the rarer home-products.&nbsp; He presently came
back of course to the knowledge that in the United States there
was&mdash;and there could be&mdash;nothing nearly so rare as the
young lady who had in fact appealed to him so straight, for was
it not precisely as a high resultant of the English climate and
the British constitution that he valued her?&nbsp; He had
relieved himself, from his New York point of view, by speaking
his mind to Lady Beauchemin, who confessed that she was
infinitely vexed with her parents.&nbsp; She agreed with him that
they had made a great mistake; they ought to have left him free;
and she expressed her confidence that such freedom could only
have been, in him, for her family, like the silence of the sage,
golden.&nbsp; He must let them down easily, must remember that
what was asked of him had been their custom for centuries.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t mention her authority as to the origin of
customs, but she promised him she would say three words to her
father and mother which would make it all right.&nbsp; Jackson
answered that customs were all very well, but that really
intelligent people recognised <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>at sight, and then indeed quite
enjoyed, the right occasion for departing from them; and with
this he awaited the result of Lady Beauchemin&rsquo;s
remonstrance.&nbsp; It had not as yet been perceptible, and it
must be said that this charming woman was herself not quite at
ease.</p>
<p>When on her venturing to hint to her mother that she thought a
wrong line had been taken with regard to her sister&rsquo;s
<i>pr&eacute;tendant</i>, Lady Canterville had replied that Mr.
Lemon&rsquo;s unwillingness to settle anything was in itself a
proof of what they had feared, the unstable nature of his
fortune&mdash;since it was useless to talk (this gracious lady
could be very decided) as if there could be any serious reason
but that one&mdash;on meeting this argument, as I say,
Jackson&rsquo;s protectress felt considerably baffled.&nbsp; It
was perhaps true, as her mother said, that if they didn&rsquo;t
insist upon proper pledges Barbarina might be left in a few years
with nothing but the stars and stripes&mdash;this odd phrase was
a quotation from Mr. Lemon&mdash;to cover her withal.&nbsp; Lady
Beauchemin tried to reason it out with Lady Marmaduke; but these
were complications unforeseen by Lady Marmaduke in her project of
an Anglo-American society.&nbsp; She was obliged to confess that
Mr. Lemon&rsquo;s fortune couldn&rsquo;t have the solidity of
long-established things; it was a very new fortune indeed.&nbsp;
His father had made the greater part of it all in a lump, a few
years before his death, in the extraordinary way in which people
made money in America; that of course was why the son had those
singular professional attributes.&nbsp; He had begun to study to
be a doctor very young, before his expectations were so
great.&nbsp; Then he had found he was very clever and very fond
of it, and had kept on because after all, in America, where there
were no country gentlemen, a young man had to have something to
do, don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; And Lady <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Marmaduke,
like an enlightened woman, intimated that in such a case she
thought it in much better taste not to try to sink
anything.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because in America, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo; she reasoned, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t sink
it&mdash;nothing <i>will</i> sink.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s
floating about&mdash;in the newspapers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
tried to console her friend by remarking that if Mr.
Lemon&rsquo;s fortune was precarious it was at all events so
big.&nbsp; That was just the trouble for Lady Beauchemin, it was
so big and yet they were going to lose it.&nbsp; He was as
obstinate as a mule; she was sure he would never come
round.&nbsp; Lady Marmaduke declared he really <i>would</i> come
round; she even offered to bet a dozen pair of <i>gants de
Su&egrave;de</i> on it; and she added that this consummation lay
quite in the hands of Barbarina.&nbsp; Lady Beauchemin promised
herself to contend with her sister, as it was not for nothing she
had herself caught the glamour of her friend&rsquo;s
international scheme.</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon, to dissipate his chagrin, had returned to the
sessions of the medical congress, where, inevitably, he had
fallen into the hands of Sidney Feeder, who enjoyed in this
disinterested assembly the highest esteem.&nbsp; It was Dr.
Feeder&rsquo;s earnest desire that his old friend should share
his credit&mdash;all the more easily that the medical congress
was, as the young physician observed, a perpetual
symposium.&nbsp; Jackson entertained the entire body at
dinner&mdash;entertained it profusely and in a manner befitting
one of the patrons of science rather than the humbler votaries;
but these dissipations made him forget but for the hour the
arrest of his relations with the house of Canterville.&nbsp; It
punctually came back to him that he was disconcerted, and Dr.
Feeder saw it stamped on his brow.&nbsp; Jackson Lemon, with his
acute inclination to open himself, was on the point more than
once of taking this sturdy friend into his confidence.&nbsp; His
colleague gave him easy <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>occasion&mdash;asked him what it was
he was thinking of all the time and whether the young marchioness
had concluded she couldn&rsquo;t swallow a doctor.&nbsp; These
forms of speech were displeasing to our baffled aspirant, whose
fastidiousness was nothing new; but he had even deeper reasons
for saying to himself that in such complicated cases as his there
was no assistance in the Sidney Feeders.&nbsp; To understand his
situation one must know the world, and the children of
Cincinnati, prohibitively provincial, didn&rsquo;t know the
world&mdash;at least the world with which this son of New York
was now concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a hitch in your marriage?&nbsp; Just tell me
that,&rdquo; Sidney Feeder had said, taking things for granted in
a manner that of itself testified to an innocence abysmal.&nbsp;
It is true he had added that he supposed he had no business to
ask; but he had been anxious about it ever since hearing from Mr.
and Mrs. Freer that the British aristocracy was down on the
medical profession.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they want you to give it
up?&nbsp; Is that what the hitch is about?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
desert your colours, Jackson.&nbsp; The suppression of pain, the
mitigation of misery, constitute surely the noblest profession in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
talking about,&rdquo; Jackson could only observe in answer to
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told any one I was going to be
married&mdash;still less have I told any one that any one objects
to my profession.&nbsp; I should like to see any one do it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve rather got out of the swim, but I don&rsquo;t regard
myself as the sort of person that people object to.&nbsp; And I
do expect to do something yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home, then, and do it.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t crush
me with grandeur if I say that the facilities for getting married
are much greater over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have found them very
great,&rdquo; Jackson sniffed.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had time really to go into
them.&nbsp; But wait till my next vacation and you&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facilities over there are too great.&nbsp;
Nothing&rsquo;s worth while but what&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo;
said Jackson with a sententious ring that quite distressed his
mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve got their backs up, I can see
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you like it.&nbsp; Only if they
despise your profession what will they say to that of your
friends?&nbsp; If they think you&rsquo;re queer what would they
think of me?&rdquo; asked Sidney Feeder, whose spirit was not as
a general thing in the least bitter, but who was pushed to this
sharpness by a conviction that&mdash;in spite of declarations
which seemed half an admission and half a denial&mdash;his friend
was suffering worry, or really perhaps something almost like
humiliation, for the sake of a good that might be gathered at
home on every bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, all that&rsquo;s
&lsquo;rot&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; This had been Jackson&rsquo;s
retort, which expressed, however, not half his feeling.&nbsp; The
other half was inexpressible, or almost, springing as it did from
his depth of displeasure at its having struck even so genial a
mind as Sidney Feeder&rsquo;s that in proposing to marry a
daughter of the highest civilisation he was going out of his
way&mdash;departing from his natural line.&nbsp; Was he then so
ignoble, so pledged to inferior things, that when he saw a girl
who&mdash;putting aside the fact that she hadn&rsquo;t genius,
which was rare, and which, though he prized rarity, he
didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;seemed to him the most naturally and
functionally founded and seated feminine subject he had known, he
was to think himself too different, too incongruous, to mate with
her?&nbsp; He would mate with whom he &ldquo;damn pleased&rdquo;;
that was the upshot of Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s passion.&nbsp;
Several days elapsed during which everybody&mdash;even the
pure-minded, like poor Sidney&mdash;seemed to him very
abject.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>All of
which is recorded to show how he, in going to see Mrs. Freer, was
prepared much less to be angry with people who, like her husband
and herself a month before, had given it out that he was engaged
to a peer&rsquo;s daughter, than to resent the insinuation that
there were obstacles to such a prospect.&nbsp; He sat with the
lady of Jermyn Street alone for half an hour in the sabbatical
stillness.&nbsp; Her husband had gone for a walk in the
Park&mdash;he always walked in the Park of a Sunday.&nbsp; All
the world might have been there and Jackson and Mrs. Freer in
sole possession of the district of Saint James&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
This perhaps had something to do with making him at last so
confidential; they had such a margin for easy egotism and
spreading sympathy.&nbsp; Mrs. Freer was ready for
anything&mdash;in the critical, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; line; she
treated him as a person she had known from the age of ten; asked
his leave to continue recumbent; talked a great deal about his
mother and seemed almost, for a while, to perform the earnest
functions of that lady.&nbsp; It had been wise of her from the
first not to allude, even indirectly, to his having neglected so
long to call; her silence on this point was in the best
taste.&nbsp; Jackson had forgotten how it was a habit with her,
and indeed a high accomplishment, never to reproach people with
these omissions.&nbsp; You might have left her alone for months
or years, her greeting was always the same; she never was either
too delighted to see you or not delighted enough.&nbsp; After a
while, however, he felt her silence to be in some measure an
allusion; she appeared to take for granted his devoting all his
hours to a certain young lady.&nbsp; It came over him for a
moment that his compatriots took a great deal for granted; but
when Mrs. Freer, rather abruptly sitting up on her sofa, said to
him half-simply, half-solemnly: &ldquo;And now, my dear Jackson,
I want you to tell me something!&rdquo;&mdash;he saw <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>that, after
all, she kept within bounds and didn&rsquo;t pretend to know more
about his business than he himself did.&nbsp; In the course of a
quarter of an hour&mdash;so appreciatively she listened&mdash;he
had given her much information.&nbsp; It was the first time he
had said so much to any one, and the process relieved him even
more than he would have supposed.&nbsp; There were things it made
clear to him by bringing them to a point&mdash;above all, the
fact that he had been wronged.&nbsp; He made no mention whatever
of its being out of the usual way that, as an American doctor, he
should sue for the hand of a marquis&rsquo;s daughter; and this
reserve was not voluntary, it was quite unconscious.&nbsp; His
mind was too full of the sudden rudeness of the Cantervilles and
the sordid side of their want of confidence.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t imagine that while he talked to Mrs.
Freer&mdash;and it amazed him afterwards that he should have
chattered so; he could account for it but by the state of his
nerves&mdash;she should be thinking only of the strangeness of
the situation he sketched for her.&nbsp; She thought Americans as
good as other people, but she didn&rsquo;t see where, in American
life, the daughter of a marquis would, as she phrased it, work
in.&nbsp; To take a simple instance&mdash;they coursed through
Mrs. Freer&rsquo;s mind with extraordinary
speed&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t she always expect to go in to dinner
first?&nbsp; As a novelty and for a change, over there, they
might like to see her do it&mdash;there might be even a pressure
for places at the show.&nbsp; But with the increase of every kind
of sophistication that was taking place in America the humorous
view to which she would owe her immediate ease mightn&rsquo;t
continue to be taken; and then where would poor Lady Barb
be?&nbsp; This was in truth a scant instance; but Mrs.
Freer&rsquo;s vivid imagination&mdash;much as she had lived in
Europe she knew her native land so well&mdash;saw a host <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>of others
massing themselves behind it.&nbsp; The consequence of all of
which was that after listening to her young friend in the most
engaging silence she raised her clasped hands, pressed them
against her breast, lowered her voice to a tone of entreaty and,
with all the charming cheer of her wisdom, uttered three words:
&ldquo;My dear Jackson,
don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;&nbsp; He took it at first
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t neglect the chance you have of getting out
of it.&nbsp; You see it would never do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew what she meant by his chance of getting out of it; he
had in his many meditations of course not overlooked that.&nbsp;
The ground the old couple had taken about settlements&mdash;and
the fact that Lady Beauchemin hadn&rsquo;t come back to him to
tell him, as she promised, that she had moved them, proved how
firmly they were rooted&mdash;would have offered an
all-sufficient pretext to a man who should have repented of his
advances.&nbsp; Jackson knew this, but knew at the same time that
he had not repented.&nbsp; The old couple&rsquo;s want of
imagination didn&rsquo;t in the least alter the fact that the
girl was, in her perfection, as he had told her father, one of
the rarest of types.&nbsp; Therefore he simply said to Mrs. Freer
that he didn&rsquo;t in the least wish to get out of it; he was
as much in it as ever and intended to remain in it.&nbsp; But
what did she mean, he asked in a moment, by her statement that it
would never do?&nbsp; Why wouldn&rsquo;t it do?&nbsp; Mrs. Freer
replied by another question&mdash;should he really like her to
tell him?&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t do because Lady Barb
wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied with her place at dinner.&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t be content&mdash;in a society of
commoners&mdash;with any but the best; and the best she
couldn&rsquo;t expect (and it was to be supposed he didn&rsquo;t
expect her) always grossly to monopolise; as people of her sort,
for that matter, did so successfully grab it in England.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;What do you mean by commoners?&rdquo; Jackson
rather grimly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean you and me and my poor husband and Dr.
Feeder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how there can be commoners where
there aren&rsquo;t lords.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the lord that makes
the commoner, and <i>vice versa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t a lady do as well?&nbsp; Our Lady
Barb&mdash;a single English girl&mdash;can make a million
inferiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be, before anything else, my wife; and she
won&rsquo;t on the whole think it any less vulgar to talk about
inferiors than I do myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll talk about, my
dear Jackson, but she&rsquo;ll think; and her thoughts
won&rsquo;t be pleasant&mdash;I mean for others.&nbsp; Do you
expect to sink her to your own rank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lemon&rsquo;s bright little eyes rested more sharply on
his hostess.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you and
don&rsquo;t think you understand yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
not absolutely candid, for he did understand Mrs. Freer to a
certain extent; it has been related that before he asked Lady
Barb&rsquo;s hand of her parents there had been moments when he
himself doubted if a flower only to be described as of the social
hothouse, that is of aristocratic air, would flourish in American
earth.&nbsp; But an intimation from another person that it was
beyond his power to pass off his wife&mdash;whether she were the
daughter of a peer or of a shoemaker&mdash;set all his blood on
fire.&nbsp; It quenched on the instant his own perception of
difficulties of detail and made him feel only that he was
dishonoured&mdash;he the heir of all the ages&mdash;by such
insinuations.&nbsp; It was his belief&mdash;though he had never
before had occasion to put it forward&mdash;that his position,
one of the best in the world, had about it the felicity that
makes everything possible.&nbsp; He had had the best education
the age could offer, for if he had rather wasted his time <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>at Harvard,
where he entered very young, he had, as he believed, been
tremendously serious at Heidelberg and at Vienna.&nbsp; He had
devoted himself to one of the noblest of professions&mdash;a
profession recognised as such everywhere but in England&mdash;and
had inherited a fortune far beyond the expectation of his earlier
years, the years when he cultivated habits of work which alone
(or rather in combination with talents that he neither
exaggerated nor undervalued) would have conduced to
distinction.&nbsp; He was one of the most fortunate inhabitants
of an immense fresh rich country, a country whose future was
admitted to be incalculable, and he moved with perfect ease in a
society in which he was not overshadowed by others.&nbsp; It
seemed to him, therefore, beneath his dignity to wonder whether
he could afford, socially speaking, to marry according to his
taste.&nbsp; He pretended to general strength, and what was the
use of strength if you weren&rsquo;t prepared to undertake things
timid people might find difficult?&nbsp; It was his plan to marry
the woman he desired and not be afraid of her afterward.&nbsp;
The effect of Mrs. Freer&rsquo;s doubt of his success was to
represent to him that his own character wouldn&rsquo;t cover his
wife&rsquo;s; she couldn&rsquo;t have made him feel worse if she
had told him that he was marrying beneath him and would have to
ask for indulgence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know
how much I think that any woman who marries me will be doing very
well,&rdquo; he promptly added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sure of that; but it isn&rsquo;t so
simple&mdash;one&rsquo;s being an American,&rdquo; Mrs. Freer
rejoined with a small philosophic sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s whatever one chooses to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll make it what no one has done yet if
you take that young lady to America and make her happy
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;Do you think our country, then, such a very
dreadful place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hostess had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a
question of what I think, but of what she will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson rose from his chair and took up his hat and
stick.&nbsp; He had actually turned a little pale with the force
of his emotion; there was a pang of wrath for him in this fact
that his marriage to Lady Barbarina might be looked at as too
high a flight.&nbsp; He stood a moment leaning against the
mantelpiece and very much tempted to say to Mrs. Freer that she
was a vulgar-minded old woman.&nbsp; But he said something that
was really more to the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget that
she&rsquo;ll have her consolations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away or I shall think I&rsquo;ve
offended you.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t console an injured
noblewoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will she be injured?&nbsp; People will be charming
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be charming to her&mdash;charming to
her!&rdquo;&nbsp; These words fell from the lips of Dexter Freer,
who had opened the door of the room and stood with the knob in
his hand, putting himself into relation to his wife&rsquo;s talk
with their visitor.&nbsp; This harmony was achieved in an
instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I know whom you mean,&rdquo; he
said while he exchanged greetings with Jackson.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
wife and I&mdash;naturally we&rsquo;re great
busybodies&mdash;have talked of your affair and we differ about
it completely.&nbsp; She sees only the dangers, while I see all
the advantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the advantages he means the fun for us,&rdquo; Mrs.
Freer explained, settling her sofa-cushions.</p>
<p>Jackson looked with a certain sharp blankness from one of
these disinterested judges to the other; even yet they scarce saw
how their misdirected freedom wrought on him.&nbsp; It was hardly
more agreeable to him to know that the husband wished to see Lady
Barb in America than to know that the wife waved <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>away such a
vision.&nbsp; There was that in Dexter Freer&rsquo;s face which
seemed to forecast the affair as taking place somehow for the
benefit of the spectators.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you both see too
much&mdash;a great deal too much&mdash;in the whole thing,&rdquo;
he rather coldly returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young man, at my age I may take certain
liberties,&rdquo; said Dexter Freer.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do</i> what
you&rsquo;ve planned&mdash;I beseech you to do it; it has never
been done before.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as if Jackson&rsquo;s
glance had challenged this last assertion he went on:
&ldquo;Never, I assure you, this particular thing.&nbsp; Young
female members of the British aristocracy have married coachmen
and fishmongers and all that sort of thing; but they&rsquo;ve
never married you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly haven&rsquo;t married the
&lsquo;likes&rsquo; of either of you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Freer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for your
advice.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be thought that Jackson Lemon took
himself rather seriously, and indeed I&rsquo;m afraid that if he
hadn&rsquo;t done so there would have been no occasion even for
this summary report of him.&nbsp; But it made him almost sick to
hear his engagement spoken of as a curious and ambiguous
phenomenon.&nbsp; He might have his own ideas about it&mdash;one
always had about one&rsquo;s engagement; but the ideas that
appeared to have peopled the imagination of his friends ended by
kindling a small hot expanse in each of his cheeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not talk any more about my little
plans,&rdquo; he added to his host.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
saying all sorts of absurd things to Mrs. Freer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been most interesting and most
infuriating,&rdquo; that lady declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been very stupidly treated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May she tell me when you go?&rdquo; her husband asked
of the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now&mdash;she may tell you whatever she
likes.&rdquo;</p>

81</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve displeased
you,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said too much what I
think.&nbsp; You must pardon me&mdash;it&rsquo;s all for your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s she whom I want Lady Barb to see!&rdquo;
Jackson exclaimed with the inconsequence of filial affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deary me!&rdquo; Mrs. Freer gently wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go back to America to see how you get
on,&rdquo; her husband said; &ldquo;and if you succeed it will be
a great precedent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I shall succeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this he took
his departure.&nbsp; He walked away with the quick step of a man
labouring under a certain excitement; walked up to Piccadilly and
down past Hyde Park Corner.&nbsp; It relieved him to measure
these distances, for he was thinking hard, under the influence of
irritation, and it was as if his movement phrased his
passion.&nbsp; Certain lights flashed on him in the last
half-hour turned to fire in him; the more that they had a
representative value and were an echo of the common voice.&nbsp;
If his prospects wore that face to Mrs. Freer they would probably
wear it to others; so he felt a strong sharp need to show such
others that they took a mean measure of his position.&nbsp; He
walked and walked till he found himself on the highway of
Hammersmith.&nbsp; I have represented him as a young man with a
stiff back, and I may appear to undermine this plea when I note
that he wrote that evening to his solicitor that Mr. Hardman was
to be informed he would agree to any proposals for settlements
that this worthy should make.&nbsp; Jackson&rsquo;s stiff back
was shown in his deciding to marry Lady Barbarina on any
terms.&nbsp; It had come over him through the action of this
desire to prove he wasn&rsquo;t afraid&mdash;so odious was the
imputation&mdash;that terms of any kind were very superficial
things.&nbsp; What was fundamental and of the essence of the
matter would be to secure the grand girl and <i>then</i> carry
everything out.</p>
<h3><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>V</h3>
<p>&ldquo;On Sundays now you might be at home,&rdquo; he said to
his wife in the following month of March&mdash;more than six
months after his marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the people any nicer on Sundays than they are on
other days?&rdquo; Lady Barb asked from the depths of her chair
and without looking up from a stiff little book.</p>
<p>He waited ever so briefly before answering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether they are, but I think you might
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as nice as I know how to be.&nbsp; You must
take me as I am.&nbsp; You knew when you married me that I
wasn&rsquo;t American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson stood before the fire toward which his wife&rsquo;s
face was turned and her feet extended; stood there some time with
his hands behind him and his eyes dropped a little obliquely on
Lady Barb&rsquo;s bent head and richly-draped figure.&nbsp; It
may be said without delay that he was sore of soul, and it may be
added that he had a double cause.&nbsp; He knew himself on the
verge of the first crisis that had occurred between himself and
his wife&mdash;the reader will note that it had occurred rather
promptly&mdash;and he was annoyed at his annoyance.&nbsp; A
glimpse of his state of mind before his marriage has been given
the reader, who will remember that at that period our young man
had believed himself lifted above possibilities of <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>irritation.&nbsp; When one was strong one wasn&rsquo;t
fidgety, and a union with a species of calm goddess would of
course be a source of repose.&nbsp; Lady Barb was a calm, was an
even calmer goddess still, and he had a much more intimate view
of her divinity than on the day he had led her to the altar; but
I&rsquo;m not sure he felt either as firm or as easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what people are?&rdquo; he said in a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen so few; you&rsquo;re
perpetually denying yourself.&nbsp; If you should leave New York
to-morrow you&rsquo;d know wonderfully little about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all just the same,&rdquo; she pleaded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The people are all exactly alike.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only
one sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&nbsp; You never see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I go out every night for the first two
months we were here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only to about a dozen houses&mdash;those, I
agree, always the same; people, moreover, you had already met in
London.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got no general impressions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her beautiful blank face.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what I <i>have</i> got; I had them before I came.&nbsp; I
see no difference whatever.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve just the same
names&mdash;just the same manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again for an instant Jackson hung fire; then he said with that
practised flat candour of which mention has already been made and
which he sometimes used in London during his courtship:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barb had returned to her book, but she looked up
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you expect me to like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you would, of course.&nbsp; I think I told you
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; You said very little
about it; you seemed to make a kind of mystery.&nbsp; I knew of
course you expected me to live here, but I didn&rsquo;t know you
expected me to like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;You thought I asked of you the sacrifice, as it
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lady
Barb.&nbsp; She got up from her chair and tossed her
unconsolatory volume into the empty seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
recommend you to read that book,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an American novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never read novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had really better look at that one.&nbsp; It will
show you the kind of people you want me to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s very vulgar,&rdquo;
Jackson said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you read
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can I do?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t always be
riding in the Park.&nbsp; I hate the Park,&rdquo; she quite rang
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as good as your own,&rdquo; said her
husband.</p>
<p>She glanced at him with a certain quickness, her eyebrows
slightly lifted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean the park at
Pasterns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I mean the park in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care about London.&nbsp; One was only
in London a few weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had a horrible lovely
ease.</p>
<p>Yet he but wanted to help her to turn round.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose you miss the country,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp; It was
his idea of life that he shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of anything,
not be afraid, in any situation, of knowing the worst that was to
be known about it; and the demon of a courage with which
discretion was not properly commingled prompted him to take
soundings that were perhaps not absolutely necessary for safety
and yet that revealed unmistakable rocks.&nbsp; It was useless to
know about rocks if he couldn&rsquo;t avoid them; the only thing
was to trust to the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I miss.&nbsp; I think I miss
everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was his wife&rsquo;s answer to his
too-curious inquiry.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t peevish, for that
wasn&rsquo;t the <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>tone of a calm goddess; but it expressed a good
deal&mdash;a good deal more than Lady Barb, who was rarely
eloquent, had expressed before.&nbsp; Nevertheless, though his
question had been precipitate, Jackson said to himself that he
might take his time to think over what her fewness of words
enclosed; he couldn&rsquo;t help seeing that the future would
give him plenty of chance.&nbsp; He was in no hurry to ask
himself whether poor Mrs. Freer, in Jermyn Street, mightn&rsquo;t
after all have been right in saying that when it came to marrying
an English caste-product it wasn&rsquo;t so simple to be an
American doctor&mdash;it might avail little even in such a case
to be the heir of all the ages.&nbsp; The transition was
complicated, but in his bright mind it was rapid, from the brush
of a momentary contact with such ideas to certain considerations
which led him to go on after an instant: &ldquo;Should you like
to go down into Connecticut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into Connecticut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of our States.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about
as large as Ireland.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take you there if you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does one do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try and get some hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can get a party to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people in the State?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we might propose it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tradespeople in the towns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true&mdash;they&rsquo;ll have to mind their
shops,&rdquo; Jackson said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we might hunt
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any foxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there are a few old cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Barb had already noted that her husband sought the relief
of a laugh at her expense, and she was aware that this present
opportunity was neither worse nor better than some others.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t mind that trick in him particularly now, though
in England <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>it would have disgusted her; she had the consciousness
of virtue, an immense comfort, and flattered herself she had
learned the lesson of an altered standard of
fitness&mdash;besides which there were so many more disagreeable
things in America than being laughed at by one&rsquo;s
husband.&nbsp; But she pretended not to like it because this made
him stop, and above all checked discussion, which with Jackson
was habitually so facetious and consequently so tiresome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only want to be left alone,&rdquo; she said in
answer&mdash;though indeed it hadn&rsquo;t the style of an
answer&mdash;to his speech about the cows.&nbsp; With this she
wandered away to one of the windows that looked out on the Fifth
Avenue.&nbsp; She was very fond of these windows and had taken a
great fancy to the Fifth Avenue, which, in the high-pitched
winter weather, when everything sparkled, was bright and funny
and foreign.&nbsp; It will be seen that she was not wholly unjust
to her adoptive country: she found it delightful to look out of
the window.&nbsp; This was a pleasure she had enjoyed in London
only in the most furtive manner; it wasn&rsquo;t the kind of
thing that girls in England did.&nbsp; Besides, in London, in
Hill Street, there was nothing particular to see; whereas in the
Fifth Avenue everything and every one went by, and observation
was made consistent with dignity by the quantities of brocade and
lace dressing the embrasure, which somehow wouldn&rsquo;t have
been tidy in England and which made an ambush without concealing
the brilliant day.&nbsp; Hundreds of women&mdash;the queer women
of New York, who were unlike any that Lady Barb had hitherto
seen&mdash;passed the house every hour; and her ladyship was
infinitely entertained and mystified by the sight of their
clothes.&nbsp; She spent more time than she was aware of in this
recreation, and had she been addicted to returning upon herself,
to asking herself for an account of her conduct&mdash;an <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>inquiry she
didn&rsquo;t indeed completely neglect, but made no great form
of&mdash;she must have had a wan smile for this proof of what she
appeared mainly to have come to America for, conscious though she
was that her tastes were very simple and that so long as she
didn&rsquo;t hunt it didn&rsquo;t much matter what she did.</p>
<p>Her husband turned about to the fire, giving a push with his
foot to a log that had fallen out of its place.&nbsp; Then he
said&mdash;and the connexion with the words she had just uttered
was direct enough&mdash;&ldquo;You really must manage to be at
home on Sundays, you know.&nbsp; I used to like that so much in
London.&nbsp; All the best women here do it.&nbsp; You had better
begin to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to see my mother.&nbsp; If I
meet any one I&rsquo;ll tell them to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them not to talk so much,&rdquo; said Lady Barb
among her lace curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear,&rdquo; Jackson returned, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t every one who has your concision.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
went and stood behind her in the window, putting his arm round
her waist.&nbsp; It was as much of a satisfaction to him as it
had been six months before, at the time the solicitors were
settling the matter, that this flower of an ancient stem should
be worn upon his own breast; he still thought its fragrance a
thing quite apart, and it was as clear as day to him that his
wife was the handsomest woman in New York.&nbsp; He had begun,
after their arrival, by telling her this very often; but the
assurance brought no colour to her cheek, no light to her eyes:
to be the handsomest woman in New York, now that she was
acquainted with that city, plainly failed to strike her as a
position in life.&nbsp; The reader may, moreover, be informed
that, oddly enough, Lady Barb didn&rsquo;t particularly believe
this assertion.&nbsp; There were some very pretty women in New
York, and without in the least wishing to be like them&mdash;she
had seen no woman in America whom she <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>desired to resemble&mdash;she envied
them some of their peculiar little freshnesses.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
probable that her own finest points were those of which she was
most unconscious.&nbsp; But Jackson was intensely aware of all of
them; nothing could exceed the minuteness of his appreciation of
his wife.&nbsp; It was a sign of this that after he had stood
behind her a moment he kissed her very tenderly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you any message for my mother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please give her my love.&nbsp; And you might take her
that book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That nasty one I&rsquo;ve been reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bother your books!&rdquo; he cried with a certain
irritation as he went out of the room.</p>
<p>There had been a good many things in her life in New York that
cost her an effort, but sending her love to her mother-in-law was
not one of these.&nbsp; She liked Mrs. Lemon better than any one
she had seen in America; she was the only person who seemed to
Lady Barb really simple, as she herself understood that
quality.&nbsp; Many people had struck her as homely and rustic
and many others as pretentious and vulgar; but in Jackson&rsquo;s
mother she had found the golden mean of a discretion, of a native
felicity and modesty and decency, which, as she would have said,
were really nice.&nbsp; Her sister, Lady Agatha, was even fonder
of Mrs. Lemon; but then Lady Agatha had taken the most
extraordinary fancy to every one and everything, and talked as if
America were the most delightful country in the world.&nbsp; She
was having a lovely time&mdash;she already spoke the most
beautiful American&mdash;and had been, during the bright winter
just drawing to a close, the most prominent girl in New
York.&nbsp; She had gone out at first with her elder; but for
some weeks past Lady Barb had let so many occasions pass that
Agatha threw herself into the <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>arms of Mrs. Lemon, who found her
unsurpassably quaint and amusing and was delighted to take her
into society.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon, as an old woman, had given up
such vanities; but she only wanted a motive, and in her good
nature she ordered a dozen new caps and sat smiling against the
wall while her little English maid, on polished floors, to the
sound of music, cultivated the American step as well as the
American tone.&nbsp; There was no trouble in New York about going
out, and the winter wasn&rsquo;t half over before the little
English maid found herself an accomplished diner, finding her way
without any chaperon at all to feasts where she could count on a
bouquet at her plate.&nbsp; She had had a great deal of
correspondence with her own female parent on this point, and Lady
Canterville had at last withdrawn her protest, which in the
meantime had been perfectly useless.&nbsp; It was ultimately Lady
Canterville&rsquo;s feeling that if she had married the
handsomest of her daughters to an American doctor she might let
another become a professional <i>raconteuse</i>&mdash;Agatha had
written to her that she was expected to talk so
much&mdash;strange as such a destiny seemed for a girl of
nineteen.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon had even a higher simplicity than Lady
Barb imputed to her; for she hadn&rsquo;t noticed that Lady
Agatha danced much oftener with Herman Longstraw than with any
one else.&nbsp; Jackson himself, though he went little to balls,
had discovered this truth, and he looked slightly preoccupied
when, after he had sat five minutes with his mother on the Sunday
afternoon through which I have invited the reader to trace so
much more than&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;is easily apparent of the
progress of this simple story, he learned that his sister-in-law
was entertaining Mr. Longstraw in the library.&nbsp; That young
man had called half an hour before, and she had taken him into
the other room to show him the seal of the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Cantervilles,
which she had fastened to one of her numerous trinkets&mdash;she
was adorned with a hundred bangles and chains&mdash;and the
proper exhibition of which required a taper and a stick of
wax.&nbsp; Apparently he was examining it very carefully, for
they had been absent a good while.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon&rsquo;s
simplicity was further shown by the fact that she had not
measured their absence; it was only when Jackson questioned her
that she remembered.</p>
<p>Herman Longstraw was a young Californian who had turned up in
New York the winter before and who travelled on his moustache, as
they were understood to say in his native State.&nbsp; This
moustache and some of its accompanying features were greatly
admired; several ladies in New York had been known to declare
that they were as beautiful as a dream.&nbsp; Taken in connexion
with his tall stature, his familiar good nature and his
remarkable Western vocabulary they constituted his only social
capital; for of the two great divisions, the rich Californians
and the poor Californians, it was well known to which he
belonged.&nbsp; Doctor Lemon had viewed him as but a slightly
mitigated cowboy, and was somewhat vexed at his own parent,
though also aware that she could scarcely figure to herself what
an effect such a form of speech as this remarkably straight echo
of the prairie would produce in the halls of Canterville.&nbsp;
He had no desire whatever to play a trick on the house to which
he was allied, and knew perfectly that Lady Agatha hadn&rsquo;t
been sent to America to become entangled with a Californian of
the wrong denomination.&nbsp; He had been perfectly willing to
bring her; he thought, a little vindictively, that this would
operate as a hint to her progenitors on what he might have
imagined doing if they hadn&rsquo;t been so stupidly bent on Mr.
Hardman.&nbsp; Herman Longstraw, according to the legend, had
been a trapper, a squatter, a <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>miner, a pioneer&mdash;had been
everything that one could be in the desperate parts of America,
and had accumulated masses of experience before the age of
thirty.&nbsp; He had shot bears in the Rockies and buffaloes on
the plains; and it was even believed that he had brought down
animals of a still more dangerous kind among the haunts of
men.&nbsp; There had been a story that he owned a cattle-ranch in
Arizona; but a later and apparently more authentic version of it,
though representing him as looking after the cattle, didn&rsquo;t
depict him as their proprietor.</p>
<p>Many of the stories told about him were false; but there was
no doubt his moustache, his native ease and his native accent
were the best of their kind.&nbsp; He danced very badly; but Lady
Agatha had frankly told several persons that that was nothing new
to her, and in short she delighted&mdash;this, however, she
didn&rsquo;t tell&mdash;in Mr. Herman Longstraw.&nbsp; What she
enjoyed in America was the revelation of freedom, and there was
no such proof of freedom as absolutely unrestricted discourse
with a gentleman who dressed in crude skins when not in New York
and who, in his usual pursuits, carried his life&mdash;as well as
that of other persons&mdash;in his hand.&nbsp; A gentleman whom
she had sat next to at dinner in the early part of her visit had
remarked to her that the United States were the paradise of women
and of mechanics; and this had seemed to her at the time very
abstract, for she wasn&rsquo;t conscious as yet of belonging to
either class.&nbsp; In England she had been only a girl, and the
principal idea connected with that was simply that for
one&rsquo;s misfortune one wasn&rsquo;t a boy.&nbsp; But she
presently herself found the odd American world a true sojourn of
the youthful blest; and this helped her to know that she must be
one of the people mentioned in the axiom of her
neighbour&mdash;people who could do whatever they wanted, had a
voice in everything <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>and made their taste and their ideas felt.&nbsp; She saw
what fun it was to be a woman in America, and that this was the
best way to enjoy the New York winter&mdash;the wonderful
brilliant New York winter, the queer long-shaped glittering city,
the heterogeneous hours among which you couldn&rsquo;t tell the
morning from the afternoon or the night from either of them, the
perpetual liberties and walks, the rushings-out and the
droppings-in, the intimacies, the endearments, the comicalities,
the sleigh-bells, the cutters, the sunsets on the snow, the
ice-parties in the frosty clearness, the bright hot velvety
houses, the bouquets, the bonbons, the little cakes, the big
cakes, the irrepressible inspirations of shopping, the
innumerable luncheons and dinners offered to youth and innocence,
the quantities of chatter of quantities of girls, the perpetual
motion of the &ldquo;German,&rdquo; the suppers at restaurants
after the play, the way in which life was pervaded by Delmonico
and Delmonico by the sense that though one&rsquo;s hunting was
lost, and this therefore so different, it was very nearly as
good.&nbsp; In all, through all, flowed a suffusion of loud
unmodulated friendly sound which reminded her of an endless
tuning of rather bad fiddles.</p>
<p>Lady Agatha was at present staying for a little change with
Mrs. Lemon, and such adventures as that were part of the pleasure
of her American season.&nbsp; The house was too close, but
physically the girl could bear anything, and it was all she had
to complain of; for Mrs. Lemon, as we know, thought her a weird
little specimen, and had none of those old-world scruples in
regard to spoiling young people to which Lady Agatha herself now
knew she must in the past have been unduly sacrificed.&nbsp; In
her own way&mdash;it was not at all her sister&rsquo;s
way&mdash;she liked to be of importance; and this was assuredly
the case when she saw that Mrs. Lemon had apparently nothing in
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the world
to do, after spending a part of the morning with her servants,
but invent little distractions&mdash;many of them of the edible
sort&mdash;for her guest.&nbsp; She appeared to have several
friends, but she had no society to speak of, and the people who
entered her house came principally to see Lady Agatha.&nbsp;
This, as we have noted, was strikingly the case with Herman
Longstraw.&nbsp; The whole situation gave the young stranger a
great feeling of success&mdash;success of a new and unexpected
kind.&nbsp; Of course in England she had been born successful, as
it might be called, through her so emerging in one of the most
beautiful rooms at Pasterns; but her present triumph was achieved
more by her own effort&mdash;not that she had tried very
hard&mdash;and by her merit.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t so much what
she said&mdash;since she could never equal for quantity the girls
of New York&mdash;as the spirit of enjoyment that played in her
fresh young face, with its pointless curves, and shone in her
grey English eyes.&nbsp; She enjoyed everything, even the
street-cars, of which she made liberal use; and more than
everything she enjoyed Mr. Longstraw and his talk about buffaloes
and bears.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon promised to be very careful as soon
as her son had begun to warn her; and this time she had a certain
understanding of what she promised.&nbsp; She thought people
ought to make the matches they liked; she had given proof of this
in her late behaviour to Jackson, whose own union was, to her
sense, marked with all the arbitrariness of pure love.&nbsp;
Nevertheless she could see that Herman Longstraw would probably
be thought rough in England; and it wasn&rsquo;t simply that he
was so inferior to Jackson, for, after all, certain things were
not to be expected.&nbsp; Jackson was not oppressed with his
mother-in-law, having taken his precautions against such a
danger; but he was certain he should give Lady Canterville a <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>permanent
advantage over him if her third daughter should while in America
attach herself to a mere moustache.</p>
<p>It was not always, as I have hinted, that Mrs. Lemon entered
completely into the views of her son, though in form she never
failed to subscribe to them devoutly.&nbsp; She had never yet,
for instance, apprehended his reason for marrying poor Lady
Barb.&nbsp; This was a great secret, and she was determined, in
her gentleness, that no one should ever know it.&nbsp; For
herself, she was sure that to the end of time she shouldn&rsquo;t
discover Jackson&rsquo;s reason.&nbsp; She might never ask about
it, for that of course would betray her.&nbsp; From the first she
had told him she was delighted, there being no need of asking for
explanations then, as the young lady herself, when she should
come to know her, would explain.&nbsp; But the young lady
hadn&rsquo;t yet explained and after this evidently never
would.&nbsp; She was very tall, very handsome, she answered
exactly to Mrs. Lemon&rsquo;s prefigurement of the daughter of a
lord, and she wore her clothes, which were peculiar, but to one
of her shape remarkably becoming, very well.&nbsp; But she
didn&rsquo;t elucidate; we know ourselves that there was very
little that was explanatory about Lady Barb.&nbsp; So Mrs. Lemon
continued to wonder, to ask herself, &ldquo;Why that one, more
than so many others who&rsquo;d have been more
natural?&rdquo;&nbsp; The choice struck her, as I have said, as
quite arbitrary.&nbsp; She found Lady Barb very different from
other girls she had known, and this led her almost immediately to
feel sorry for her daughter-in-law.&nbsp; She felt how the girl
was to be pitied if she found her husband&rsquo;s people as
peculiar as his mother found <i>her</i>, since the result of that
would be to make her very lonesome.&nbsp; Lady Agatha was
different, because she seemed to keep nothing back; you saw all
there was of her, and she was evidently not <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>home-sick.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon could see that Barbarina was
ravaged by this last ailment and was also too haughty to show
it.&nbsp; She even had a glimpse of the ultimate truth; namely,
that Jackson&rsquo;s wife had not the comfort of crying, because
that would have amounted to a confession that she had been
idiotic enough to believe in advance that, in an American town,
in the society of doctors, she should escape such pangs.&nbsp;
Mrs. Lemon treated her with studied consideration&mdash;all the
indulgence that was due to a young woman in the unfortunate
position of having been married one couldn&rsquo;t tell why.</p>
<p>The world, to the elder lady&rsquo;s view, contained two great
departments, that of people and that of things; and she believed
you must take an interest either in one or the other.&nbsp; The
true incomprehensible in Lady Barb was that she cared for neither
side of the show.&nbsp; Her house apparently inspired her with no
curiosity and no enthusiasm, though it had been thought
magnificent enough to be described in successive columns of the
native newspapers; and she never spoke of her furniture or her
domestics, though she had a prodigious show of such
possessions.&nbsp; She was the same with regard to her
acquaintance, which was immense, inasmuch as every one in the
place had called on her.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon was the least critical
woman in the world, but it had occasionally ruffled her just a
little that her daughter-in-law should receive every one in New
York quite in the same automatic manner.&nbsp; There were
differences, Mrs. Lemon knew, and some of them of the highest
importance; but poor Lady Barb appeared never to suspect
them.&nbsp; She accepted every one and everything and asked no
questions.&nbsp; She had no curiosity about her fellow-citizens,
and as she never assumed it for a moment she gave Mrs. Lemon no
opportunity to enlighten her.&nbsp; Lady Barb was a person with
whom you could do nothing unless she <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>left you an opening; and nothing
would have been more difficult than to &ldquo;post&rdquo; her, as
her mother-in-law would have said, against her will.&nbsp; Of
course she picked up a little knowledge, but she confounded and
transposed American attributes in the most extraordinary
way.&nbsp; She had a way of calling every one Doctor; and Mrs.
Lemon could scarcely convince her that this distinction was too
precious to be so freely bestowed.&nbsp; She had once said to
that supporter that in New York there was nothing to know people
by, their names were so very monotonous; and Mrs. Lemon had
entered into this enough to see that there was something that
stood out a good deal in Barbarina&rsquo;s own prefix.&nbsp; It
is probable that during her short period of domestication
complete justice was not done Lady Barb; she never&mdash;as an
instance&mdash;got credit for repressing her annoyance at the
poverty of the nominal signs and styles, a deep desolation.&nbsp;
That little speech to her husband&rsquo;s mother was the most
reckless sign she gave of it; and there were few things that
contributed more to the good conscience she habitually enjoyed
than her self-control on this particular point.</p>
<p>Doctor Lemon was engaged in professional researches just now,
which took up a great deal of his time; and for the rest he
passed his hours unreservedly with his wife.&nbsp; For the last
three months, therefore, he had seen his other nearest relative
scarcely more than once a week.&nbsp; In spite of researches, in
spite of medical societies, where Jackson, to her knowledge, read
papers, Lady Barb had more of her husband&rsquo;s company than
she had counted on at the time she married.&nbsp; She had never
known a married pair to be so much together as she and Jackson;
he appeared to expect her to sit with him in the library in the
morning.&nbsp; He had none of the occupations of gentlemen and
noblemen in England, for the element of <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>politics
appeared to be as absent as the element of the chase.&nbsp; There
were politics in Washington, she had been told, and even at
Albany, and Jackson had proposed to introduce her to these
cities; but the proposal, made to her once at dinner, before
several people, had excited such cries of horror that it fell
dead on the spot.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to see
anything of that kind,&rdquo; one of the ladies had said, and
Jackson had appeared to be discouraged&mdash;that is if in regard
to Jackson she could really tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray what is it you want me to see?&rdquo; Lady Barb
had asked on this occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, New York and Boston (Boston if you want to very
much, but not otherwise), and then Niagara.&nbsp; But more than
anything Newport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was tired of their eternal Newport; she had heard of it a
thousand times and felt already as if she had lived there half
her life; she was sure, moreover, that she should hate the awful
little place.&nbsp; This is perhaps as near as she came to having
a lively conviction on any American subject.&nbsp; She asked
herself whether she was then to spend her life in the Fifth
Avenue with alternations of a city of villas&mdash;she detested
villas&mdash;and wondered if that was all the great American
country had to offer her.&nbsp; There were times when she
believed she should like the backwoods and that the Far West
might be a resource; for she had analysed her feelings just deep
enough to discover that when she had&mdash;hesitating a good
deal&mdash;turned over the question of marrying Jackson Lemon it
was not in the least of American barbarism she was afraid; her
dread had been all of American civilisation.&nbsp; She judged the
little lady I have just quoted a goose, but that didn&rsquo;t
make New York any more interesting.&nbsp; It would be reckless to
say that she suffered from an overdose of Jackson&rsquo;s
company, since she quite felt him her most important social <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>resource.&nbsp; She could talk to him about England,
about her own England, and he understood more or less what she
wished to say&mdash;when she wished to say anything, which was
not frequent.&nbsp; There were plenty of other people who talked
about England; but with them the range of allusion was always the
hotels, of which she knew nothing, and the shops and the opera
and the photographs: they had the hugest appetite for
photographs.&nbsp; There were other people who were always
wanting her to tell them about Pasterns and the manner of life
there and the parties; but if there was one thing Lady Barb
disliked more than another it was describing Pasterns.&nbsp; She
had always lived with people who knew of themselves what such a
place would be, without demanding these pictorial efforts, proper
only, as she vaguely felt, to persons belonging to the classes
whose trade was the arts of expression.&nbsp; Lady Barb of course
had never gone into it; but she knew that in her own class the
business was not to express but to enjoy, not to represent but to
be represented&mdash;though indeed this latter liability might
involve offence; for it may be noted that even for an aristocrat
Jackson Lemon&rsquo;s wife was aristocratic.</p>
<p>Lady Agatha and her visitor came back from the library in
course of time, and Jackson Lemon felt it his duty to be rather
cold to Herman Longstraw.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t clear to him what
sort of a husband his sister-in-law would do well to look for in
America&mdash;if there were to be any question of husbands; but
as to that he wasn&rsquo;t bound to be definite provided he
should rule out Mr. Longstraw.&nbsp; This gentleman, however, was
not given to noticing shades of manner; he had little
observation, but very great confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better come home with me,&rdquo;
Jackson said to Lady Agatha; &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve stayed
here long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him say that, Mrs. Lemon!&rdquo;
the girl cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like being with you so
awfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to make it pleasant,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lemon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should really miss you now; but perhaps
it&rsquo;s your mother&rsquo;s wish.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it was a
question of defending her guest from ineligible suitors Mrs.
Lemon felt of course that her son was more competent than she;
though she had a lurking kindness for Herman Longstraw and a
vague idea that he was a gallant genial specimen of
unsophisticated young America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mamma wouldn&rsquo;t see any difference!&rdquo; Lady
Agatha returned with pleading blue eyes on her
brother-in-law.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma wants me to see every one; you
know she does.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what she sent me to America
for; she knows&mdash;for we&rsquo;ve certainly told her
enough&mdash;that it isn&rsquo;t like England.&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t like it if I didn&rsquo;t sometimes stay with
people; she always wanted us to stay at other houses.&nbsp; And
she knows all about you, Mrs. Lemon, and she likes you
immensely.&nbsp; She sent you a message the other day and
I&rsquo;m afraid I forgot to give it you&mdash;to thank you for
being so kind to me and taking such a lot of trouble.&nbsp;
Really she did, but I forgot it.&nbsp; If she wants me to see as
much as possible of America it&rsquo;s much better I should be
here than always with Barb&mdash;it&rsquo;s much less like
one&rsquo;s own country.&nbsp; I mean it&rsquo;s much
nicer&mdash;for a girl,&rdquo; said Lady Agatha affectionately to
Mrs. Lemon, who began also to look at Jackson under the influence
of this uttered sweetness which was like some quaint little old
air, she thought, played upon a faded spinet with two girlish
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want the genuine thing you ought to come out on
the plains,&rdquo; Mr. Longstraw interposed with bright
sincerity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess that was your mother&rsquo;s
idea.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you all come out?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
been looking intently at Lady Agatha while the remarks I have
just repeated succeeded each other on her <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>lips&mdash;looking at her with a fascinated
approbation, for all the world as if he had been a slightly
slow-witted English gentleman and the girl herself a flower of
the West, a flower that knew the celebrated language of
flowers.&nbsp; Susceptible even as Mrs. Lemon was he made no
secret of the fact that Lady Agatha&rsquo;s voice was music to
him, his ear being much more accessible than his own inflexions
would have indicated.&nbsp; To Lady Agatha those inflexions were
not displeasing, partly because, like Mr. Herman himself in
general, she had not a perception of shades; and partly because
it never occurred to her to compare them with any other
tones.&nbsp; He seemed to her to speak a foreign language
altogether&mdash;a romantic dialect through which the most
comical meanings gleamed here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like it above all things,&rdquo; she said in
answer to his last observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scenery&rsquo;s ahead of anything round
here,&rdquo; Mr. Longstraw went on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lemon, as we have gathered, was the mildest of women;
but, as an old New Yorker, she had no patience with some of the
new fashions.&nbsp; Chief among these was the perpetual
reference, which had become common only within a few years, to
the outlying parts of the country, the States and Territories of
which children, in her time, used to learn the names, in their
order, at school, but which no one ever thought of going to or
talking about.&nbsp; Such places, in her opinion, belonged to the
geography-books, or at most to the literature of newspapers, but
neither to society nor to conversation; and the
change&mdash;which, so far as it lay in people&rsquo;s talk, she
thought at bottom a mere affectation&mdash;threatened to make her
native land appear vulgar and vague.&nbsp; For this amiable
daughter of Manhattan the normal existence of man, and still more
of women, had been <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;located,&rdquo; as she would have said, between
Trinity Church and the beautiful Reservoir at the top of the
Fifth Avenue&mdash;monuments of which she was personally proud;
and if we could look into the deeper parts of her mind I am
afraid we should discover there an impression that both the
countries of Europe and the remainder of her own continent were
equally far from the centre and the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, scenery isn&rsquo;t everything,&rdquo; she made
soft answer to Mr. Longstraw; &ldquo;and if Lady Agatha should
wish to see anything of that kind all she has got to do is to
take the boat up the Hudson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon&rsquo;s
recognition of this river, I should say, was all it need have
been; she held the Hudson existed for the purpose of supplying
New Yorkers with poetical feelings, helping them to face
comfortably occasions like the present and, in general, meet
foreigners with confidence&mdash;part of the oddity of foreigners
being their conceit about their own places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Lady Agatha; let&rsquo;s take
the boat,&rdquo; said Mr. Longstraw.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
great times on the boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Agatha fixed on her <i>amoroso</i> her singular charming
eyes, eyes of which it was impossible to say at any moment
whether they were the shyest or the frankest in the world; and
she was not aware while this contemplation lasted that her
brother-in-law was observing her.&nbsp; He was thinking of
certain things while he did so, of things he had heard about the
English; who still, in spite of his having married into a family
of that nation, appeared to him very much through the medium of
hearsay.&nbsp; They were more passionate than the Americans, and
they did things that would never have been expected; though they
seemed steadier and less excitable there was much social evidence
to prove them more wildly impulsive.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so very kind of you to propose
that,&rdquo; Lady Agatha said in a moment to Mrs. Lemon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve never been in a ship&mdash;except of
course coming from England.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure mamma would wish
me to see the Hudson.&nbsp; We used to go in immensely for
boating in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you boat in a ship?&rdquo; Herman Longstraw asked,
showing his teeth hilariously and pulling his moustaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of my mother&rsquo;s people have been in the
navy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Agatha perceived vaguely and
good-naturedly that she had said something the odd Americans
thought odd and that she must justify herself.&nbsp; Something
most unnatural was happening to her standard of oddity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think you had better come back to us,&rdquo;
Jackson repeated: &ldquo;your sister&rsquo;s very lonely without
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s much more lonely <i>with</i> me.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re perpetually having differences.&nbsp; Barb&rsquo;s
dreadfully vexed because I like America instead of&mdash;instead
of&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lady Agatha paused a moment; for it
just occurred to her that this might be treacherous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of what?&rdquo; Jackson inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of perpetually wanting to go to England, as she
does,&rdquo; she went on, only giving her phrase a little softer
turn; for she felt the next moment that Barb could have nothing
to hide and must of course have the courage of her
opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course England&rsquo;s best, but I
daresay I like to be bad,&rdquo; the girl said artlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s no doubt you&rsquo;re awfully
bad,&rdquo; Mr. Longstraw broke out, with joyous eagerness.&nbsp;
Naturally he couldn&rsquo;t know that what she had principally in
mind was an exchange of opinions that had taken place between her
sister and herself just before she came to stay with Mrs.
Lemon.&nbsp; This incident, of <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>which he himself was the occasion,
might indeed have been called a discussion, for it had carried
them quite into the cold air of the abstract.&nbsp; Lady Barb had
said she didn&rsquo;t see how Agatha could look at such a
creature as that&mdash;an odious familiar vulgar being who had
not about him the rudiments of a gentleman.&nbsp; Lady Agatha had
replied that Mr. Longstraw was familiar and rough and that he had
a twang and thought it amusing to talk to her as &ldquo;the
Princess&rdquo;; but that he was a gentleman for all that and was
tremendous fun whatever one called him&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t seem
to matter what one called any one or anything there.&nbsp; Her
sister had returned to this that if he was rough and familiar he
couldn&rsquo;t be a gentleman, inasmuch as that was just what a
gentleman meant&mdash;a man who was civil and well-bred and
well-born.&nbsp; Lady Agatha had argued that such a point was
just where she differed; that a man might perfectly be a
gentleman and yet be rough, and even ignorant, so long as he was
really nice.&nbsp; The only thing was that he should be really
nice, which was the case with Mr. Longstraw, who, moreover, was
quite extraordinarily civil&mdash;as civil as a man could
be.&nbsp; And then Lady Agatha herself made the strongest point
she had ever made in her life (she had never been so inspired) in
saying that Mr. Longstraw was rough perhaps, but not rude&mdash;a
distinction altogether wasted on her sister, who declared that
she hadn&rsquo;t come to America, of all places, to learn what a
gentleman was.&nbsp; The discussion in short had been a trifle
grim.&nbsp; I know not whether it was the tonic effect on them
too, alien organisms as they were, of the fine winter weather, or
that of Lady Barb&rsquo;s being bored and having nothing else to
do; but Lord Canterville&rsquo;s daughters went into the question
with the moral earnestness of a pair of approved
Bostonians.&nbsp; It was part of Lady Agatha&rsquo;s view of her
admirer that he <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>after all much resembled other tall people with smiling
eyes and tawny moustaches who had ridden a good deal in rough
countries and whom she had seen in other places.&nbsp; If he was
more familiar he was also more alert; still, the difference was
not in himself, but in the way she saw him&mdash;the way she saw
everybody in America.&nbsp; If she should see the others in the
same way no doubt they&rsquo;d be quite the same; and Lady Agatha
sighed a little over the possibilities of life; for this peculiar
way, especially regarded in connexion with gentlemen, had become
very pleasant to her.</p>
<p>She had betrayed her sister more than she thought, even though
Jackson didn&rsquo;t particularly show it in the tone in which he
commented: &ldquo;Of course she knows she&rsquo;s going to see
your mother in the summer.&rdquo;&nbsp; His tone was rather that
of irritation at so much harping on the very obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it isn&rsquo;t only mamma,&rdquo; the girl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she likes a cool house,&rdquo; Mrs. Lemon
contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she goes you had better bid her good-bye,&rdquo;
Lady Agatha went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall bid her good-bye,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lemon, to whom apparently this remark was addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never bid <i>you</i> good-bye,
Princess,&rdquo; Herman Longstraw interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can bet your life on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it doesn&rsquo;t matter about me, for of course I
shall come back; but if Barb once gets to England she never
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my dear child!&rdquo; Mrs. Lemon wailed, addressing
her young visitor, but looking at her son, who on his side looked
at the ceiling, at the floor, looked above all very
conscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind my saying that, Jackson <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>dear,&rdquo; Lady Agatha said to him, for she was very
fond of her brother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well then, she shan&rsquo;t go there,&rdquo; he
threw off in a moment with a small strange dry laugh that
attached his mother&rsquo;s eyes in shy penetration to his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you promised mamma, you know,&rdquo; said the girl
with the confidence of her affection.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s countenance expressed to her none even of his
very moderate hilarity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother, then, must
bring her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get some of your navy people to supply an
ironclad!&rdquo; cried Mr. Longstraw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be very pleasant if the Marchioness could come
over,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lemon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh she&rsquo;d hate it more than poor Barb,&rdquo; Lady
Agatha quickly replied.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t at all suit her to
find a marchioness inserted into her field of vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she feel interested from what
you&rsquo;ve told her?&rdquo; Lady Agatha&rsquo;s admirer
inquired.&nbsp; But Jackson didn&rsquo;t heed his
sister-in-law&rsquo;s answer&mdash;he was thinking of something
else.&nbsp; He said nothing more, however, about the subject of
his thought, and before ten minutes were over took his departure,
having meanwhile neglected also to revert to the question of Lady
Agatha&rsquo;s bringing her visit to his mother to a close.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t to speak to him of this&mdash;for, as we know,
she wished to keep the girl and somehow couldn&rsquo;t bring
herself to be afraid of Herman Longstraw&mdash;that when her son
took leave she went with him to the door of the house, detaining
him a little while she stood on the steps, as people had always
done in New York in her time, though it was another of the new
fashions she didn&rsquo;t like, the stiffness of not coming out
of the parlour.&nbsp; She placed her hand on his arm to keep him
on the &ldquo;stoop&rdquo; and looked up and down into the lucid
afternoon and the beautiful city&mdash;its chocolate-coloured
houses so <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>extraordinarily smooth&mdash;in which it seemed to her
that even the most fastidious people ought to be glad to
live.&nbsp; It was useless to attempt to conceal it: his marriage
had made a difference and a worry, had put a barrier that she was
yet under the painful obligation of trying to seem not to
notice.&nbsp; It had brought with it a problem much more
difficult than his old problem of how to make his mother feel
herself still, as she had been in his childhood, the dispenser of
his rewards.&nbsp; The old problem had been easily solved, the
new was a great tax.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon was sure her
daughter-in-law didn&rsquo;t take her seriously, and that was a
part of the barrier.&nbsp; Even if Barbarina liked her better
than any one else this was mostly because she liked every one
else so little.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon had in her nature no grain of
resentment, and it wasn&rsquo;t to feed a sense of wrong that she
permitted herself to criticise her son&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that his marriage wasn&rsquo;t
altogether fortunate if his wife didn&rsquo;t take his mother
seriously.&nbsp; She knew she wasn&rsquo;t otherwise remarkable
than as being his mother; but that position, which was no merit
of hers&mdash;the merit was all Jackson&rsquo;s in being her
son&mdash;affected her as one which, familiar as Lady Barb
appeared to have been in England with positions of various kinds,
would naturally strike the girl as very high and to be accepted
as freely as a fine morning.&nbsp; If she didn&rsquo;t think of
his mother as an indivisible part of him perhaps she didn&rsquo;t
think of other things either; and Mrs. Lemon vaguely felt that,
remarkable as Jackson was, he was made up of parts, and that it
would never do that these should be rated lower one by one, since
there was no knowing what that might end in.&nbsp; She feared
that things were rather cold for him at home when he had to
explain so much to his wife&mdash;explain to her, for instance,
all the sources of happiness that were to be found in New
York.&nbsp; This struck her as a new kind of <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>problem
altogether for a husband.&nbsp; She had never thought of
matrimony without a community of feeling in regard to religion
and country; one took those great conditions for granted just as
one assumed that one&rsquo;s food was to be cooked; and if
Jackson should have to discuss them with his wife he might, in
spite of his great abilities, be carried into regions where he
would get entangled and embroiled&mdash;from which even possibly
he wouldn&rsquo;t come back at all.&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon had a horror
of losing him in some way, and this fear was in her eyes as she
stood by the doorway of her house and, after she had glanced up
and down the street, eyed him a moment in silence.&nbsp; He
simply kissed her again and said she would take cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of that&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a
shawl!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Lemon, who was very small and very fair,
with pointed features and an elaborate cap, passed her life in a
shawl, and owed to this habit her reputation for being an
invalid&mdash;an idea she scorned, naturally enough, inasmuch as
it was precisely her shawl that, as she believed, kept every ill
at bay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it true Barbarina won&rsquo;t come
back?&rdquo; she then asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we shall ever find out; I
don&rsquo;t know that I shall take her to England,&rdquo; Jackson
distinctly returned.</p>
<p>She looked more anxious still.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
promise, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I promised&mdash;not
absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t keep her here against her
will?&rdquo; quavered Mrs. Lemon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;ll get used to it,&rdquo; he returned
with a levity that misrepresented the state of his nerves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lemon looked up and down the street again and gave a
little sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity she isn&rsquo;t
American!&rdquo;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t mean this as a reproach,
a hint of what might have been; it was simply embarrassment
resolved into speech.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have been American,&rdquo;
said Jackson with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t she, dear?&rdquo;&nbsp; His mother spoke
with conscientious respect; she felt there were imperceptible
reasons in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just as she is that I wanted her,&rdquo; Jackson
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she won&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo; Mrs. Lemon
went on with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh she has got to come back!&rdquo; Jackson said as he
went down the steps.</p>
<h3><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>VI</h3>
<p>Lady Barb, after this, didn&rsquo;t decline to see her New
York acquaintances on Sunday afternoons, though she refused for
the present to enter into a project of her husband&rsquo;s, who
thought it would be pleasant she should entertain his friends on
the evening of that day.&nbsp; Like all good Americans, Doctor
Lemon devoted much consideration to the great question of how, in
his native land, society was to be brought into being.&nbsp; It
seemed to him it would help on the good cause, for which so many
Americans are ready to lay down their lives, if his wife should,
as he jocularly called it, open a saloon.&nbsp; He believed, or
tried to believe, the <i>salon</i> now possible in New York on
condition of its being reserved entirely for adults; and in
having taken a wife out of a country in which social traditions
were rich and ancient he had done something toward qualifying his
own house&mdash;so splendidly qualified in all strictly material
respects&mdash;to be the scene of such an effort.&nbsp; A
charming woman accustomed only to the best on each side, as Lady
Beauchemin said, what mightn&rsquo;t she achieve by being at
home&mdash;always to adults only&mdash;in an easy early inspiring
comprehensive way and on the evening of the seven when worldly
engagements were least numerous?&nbsp; He laid this philosophy
before Lady Barb in pursuance of a theory that if she disliked
New York on a short acquaintance she couldn&rsquo;t <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>fail to
like it on a long.&nbsp; Jackson believed in the New York
mind&mdash;not so much indeed in its literary artistic
philosophic or political achievements as in its general quickness
and nascent adaptability.&nbsp; He clung to this belief, for it
was an indispensable neat block in the structure he was
attempting to rear.&nbsp; The New York mind would throw its
glamour over Lady Barb if she would only give it a chance; for it
was thoroughly bright responsive and sympathetic.&nbsp; If she
would only set up by the turn of her hand a blest snug social
centre, a temple of interesting talk in which this charming organ
might expand and where she might inhale its fragrance in the most
convenient and luxurious way, without, as it were, getting up
from her chair; if she would only just try this graceful
good-natured experiment&mdash;which would make every one like
<i>her</i> so much too&mdash;he was sure all the wrinkles in the
gilded scroll of his fate would be smoothed out.&nbsp; But Lady
Barb didn&rsquo;t rise at all to his conception and hadn&rsquo;t
the least curiosity about the New York mind.&nbsp; She thought it
would be extremely disagreeable to have a lot of people tumbling
in on Sunday evening without being invited; and altogether her
husband&rsquo;s sketch of the Anglo-American saloon seemed to her
to suggest crude familiarity, high vociferation&mdash;she had
already made a remark to him about &ldquo;screeching
women&rdquo;&mdash;and random extravagant laughter.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t tell him&mdash;for this somehow it wasn&rsquo;t in
her power to express, and, strangely enough, he never completely
guessed it&mdash;that she was singularly deficient in any natural
or indeed acquired understanding of what a saloon might be.&nbsp;
She had never seen or dreamed of one&mdash;and for the most part
was incapable of imagining a thing she hadn&rsquo;t seen.&nbsp;
She had seen great dinners and balls and meets and runs and
races; she had seen garden-parties and bunches <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of people,
mainly women&mdash;who, however, didn&rsquo;t screech&mdash;at
dull stuffy teas, and distinguished companies collected in
splendid castles; but all this gave her no clue to a train of
conversation, to any idea of a social agreement that the interest
of talk, its continuity, its accumulations from season to season,
shouldn&rsquo;t be lost.&nbsp; Conversation, in Lady Barb&rsquo;s
experience, had never been continuous; in such a case it would
surely have been a bore.&nbsp; It had been occasional and
fragmentary, a trifle jerky, with allusions that were never
explained; it had a dread of detail&mdash;it seldom pursued
anything very far or kept hold of it very long.</p>
<p>There was something else she didn&rsquo;t say to her husband
in reference to his visions of hospitality, which was that if she
should open a saloon&mdash;she had taken up the joke as well, for
Lady Barb was eminently good-natured&mdash;Mrs. Vanderdecken
would straightway open another, and Mrs. Vanderdecken&rsquo;s
would be the more successful of the two.&nbsp; This lady, for
reasons Lady Barb had not yet explored, passed for the great
personage of New York; there were legends of her husband&rsquo;s
family having behind them a fabulous antiquity.&nbsp; When this
was alluded to it was spoken of as something incalculable and
lost in the dimness of time.&nbsp; Mrs. Vanderdecken was young,
pretty, clever, incredibly pretentious, Lady Barb thought, and
had a wonderfully artistic house.&nbsp; Ambition was expressed,
further, in every rustle of her garments; and if she was the
first lady in America, &ldquo;bar none&rdquo;&mdash;this had an
immense sound&mdash;it was plain she intended to retain the
character.&nbsp; It was not till after she had been several
months in New York that Lady Barb began to perceive this easy
mistress of the field, crying out, gracious goodness, before she
was hurt, to have flung down the glove; and when the idea
presented itself, lighted up by an incident I have no space to
report, she simply <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>blushed a little (for Mrs. Vanderdecken) and held her
tongue.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t come to America to bandy words
about &ldquo;precedence&rdquo; with such a woman as that.&nbsp;
She had ceased to think of that convenience&mdash;of course one
was obliged to think in England; though an instinct of
self-preservation, old and deep-seated, led her not to expose
herself to occasions on which her imputed claim might be
tested.&nbsp; This had at bottom much to do with her having, very
soon after the first flush of the honours paid her on her arrival
and which seemed to her rather grossly overdone, taken the line
of scarcely going out.&nbsp; &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t keep
<i>that</i> up!&rdquo; she had said to herself; and in short she
would stay, less boringly both for herself and for others, at
home.&nbsp; She had a sense that whenever and wherever she might
go forth she should meet Mrs. Vanderdecken, who would withhold or
deny or contest or even magnanimously concede
something&mdash;poor Lady Barb could never imagine what.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t try to, and gave little thought to all this; for
she wasn&rsquo;t prone to confess to herself fears, especially
fears from which terror was absent.&nbsp; What in the world
<i>had</i> Mrs. Vanderdecken that she, Barbarina Lemon (what a
name!), could want?&nbsp; But, as I have said, it abode within
her as a presentiment that if she should set up a drawing-room in
the foreign style (based, that is, on the suppression of
prattling chits and hobbledehoys) this sharp skirmisher would be
beforehand with her.&nbsp; The continuity of conversation, oh
that she would certainly go in for&mdash;there was no one so
continuous as Mrs. Vanderdecken.&nbsp; Lady Barb, as I have
related, didn&rsquo;t give her husband the surprise of confiding
to him these thoughts, though she had given him some other
surprises.&nbsp; He would have been decidedly astonished, and
perhaps after a bit a little encouraged, at finding her liable to
any marked form of exasperation.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>On
the Sunday afternoon she was visible; and at one of these
junctures, going into her drawing-room late, he found her
entertaining two ladies and a gentleman.&nbsp; The gentleman was
Sidney Feeder and one of the ladies none other than Mrs.
Vanderdecken, whose ostensible relations with her were indeed of
the most cordial nature.&nbsp; Intending utterly to crush
her&mdash;as two or three persons, not perhaps conspicuous for a
narrow accuracy, gave out that she privately declared&mdash;Mrs.
Vanderdecken yet wished at least to study the weak points of the
invader, to penetrate herself with the character of the English
girl.&nbsp; Lady Barb verily appeared to have for the
representative of the American patriciate a mysterious
fascination.&nbsp; Mrs. Vanderdecken couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes
off her victim and, whatever might be her estimate of her
importance, at least couldn&rsquo;t let her alone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why does she come to see me?&rdquo; poor Lady Barb asked
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to see
her; she has done enough for civility long ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Vanderdecken had her own reasons, one of which was simply the
pleasure of looking at the Doctor&rsquo;s wife, as she habitually
called the daughter of the Cantervilles.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t
guilty of the rashness of depreciating the appearance of so
markedly fine a young woman, but professed a positive unbounded
admiration for it, defending it on many occasions against those
of the superficial and stupid who pronounced her &ldquo;left
nowhere&rdquo; by the best of the home-grown specimens.&nbsp;
Whatever might have been Lady Barb&rsquo;s weak points, they
included neither the curve of her cheek and chin, the setting of
her head on her throat, nor the quietness of her deep eyes, which
were as beautiful as if they had been blank, like those of
antique busts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The head&rsquo;s
enchanting&mdash;perfectly enchanting,&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderdecken
used to say irrelevantly and as if there were only one head in
the place.&nbsp; She always <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>used to ask about the
Doctor&mdash;which was precisely another reason why she
came.&nbsp; She dragged in the Doctor at every turn, asking if he
were often called up at night; found it the greatest of luxuries,
in a word, to address Lady Barb as the wife of a medical man and
as more or less <i>au courant</i> of her husband&rsquo;s
patients.&nbsp; The other lady, on this Sunday afternoon, was a
certain little Mrs. Chew, who had the appearance of a small but
very expensive doll and was always asking Lady Barb about
England, which Mrs. Vanderdecken never did.&nbsp; The latter
discoursed on a purely American basis and with that continuity of
which mention has already been made, while Mrs. Chew engaged
Sidney Feeder on topics equally local.&nbsp; Lady Barb liked
Sidney Feeder; she only hated his name, which was constantly in
her ears during the half-hour the ladies sat with her, Mrs. Chew
having, like so many persons in New York, the habit, which
greatly annoyed her, of re-apostrophising and re-designating
every one present.</p>
<p>Lady Barb&rsquo;s relations with Mrs. Vanderdecken consisted
mainly in wondering, while she talked, what she wanted of her,
and in looking, with her sculptured eyes, at her visitor&rsquo;s
clothes, in which there was always much to examine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh Doctor Feeder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Now Doctor Feeder!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well Doctor Feeder&rdquo;&mdash;these exclamations, on
Mrs. Chew&rsquo;s lips, were an undertone in Lady Barb&rsquo;s
consciousness.&nbsp; When we say she liked her husband&rsquo;s
confr&egrave;re, as he never failed to describe himself, we
understand that she smiled on his appearance and gave him her
hand, and asked him if he would have tea.&nbsp; There was nothing
nasty, as they so analytically said in London, about Lady Barb,
and she would have been incapable of inflicting a deliberate snub
on a man who had the air of standing up so squarely to any
purpose he might have in hand.&nbsp; But she had nothing of her
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>own at
all to say to Sidney Feeder.&nbsp; He apparently had the art of
making her shy, more shy than usual&mdash;since she was always a
little so; she discouraged him, discouraged him completely and
reduced him to naught.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t a man who wanted
drawing out, there was nothing of that in him, he was remarkably
copious; but she seemed unable to follow him in any direction and
half the time evidently didn&rsquo;t know what he was
saying.&nbsp; He tried to adapt his conversation to her needs;
but when he spoke of the world, of what was going on in society,
she was more at sea even than when he spoke of hospitals and
laboratories and the health of the city and the progress of
science.&nbsp; She appeared indeed after her first smile when he
came in, which was always charming, scarcely to see
him&mdash;looking past him and above him and below him,
everywhere but at him, till he rose to go again, when she gave
him another smile, as expressive of pleasure and of casual
acquaintance as that with which she had greeted his entry: it
seemed to imply that they had been having delightful
communion.&nbsp; He wondered what the deuce Jackson Lemon could
find interesting in such a woman, and he believed his perverse,
though gifted, colleague not destined to feel her in the long run
enrich or illuminate his life.&nbsp; He pitied Jackson, he saw
that Lady Barb, in New York, would neither assimilate nor be
assimilated; and yet he was afraid, for very compassion, to
betray to the poor man how the queer step he had taken&mdash;now
so dreadfully irrevocable&mdash;might be going to strike most
others.&nbsp; Sidney Feeder was a man of a strenuous conscience,
who did loyal duty overmuch and from the very fear he
mightn&rsquo;t do it enough.&nbsp; In order not to appear to he
called upon Lady Barb heroically, in spite of pressing
engagements and week after week, enjoying his virtue himself as
little as he made it fruitful for his hostess, who <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>wondered at
last what she had done to deserve this extremity of
appreciation.</p>
<p>She spoke of it to her husband, who wondered also what poor
Sidney had in his head and yet naturally shrank from damping too
brutally his zeal.&nbsp; Between the latter&rsquo;s wish not to
let Jackson see his marriage had made a difference and
Jackson&rsquo;s hesitation to reveal to him that his standard of
friendship was too high, Lady Barb passed a good many of those
numerous hours during which she asked herself if they were the
&ldquo;sort of thing&rdquo; she had come to America for.&nbsp;
Very little had ever passed between her and her husband on the
subject of the most regular of her bores, a clear instinct
warning her that if they were ever to have scenes she must choose
the occasion well, and this odd person not being an
occasion.&nbsp; Jackson had tacitly admitted that his
&ldquo;confr&egrave;re&rdquo; was anything she chose to think
him; he was not a man to be guilty in a discussion of the
disloyalty of damning a real friend with praise that was
faint.&nbsp; If Lady Agatha had been less of an absentee from her
sister&rsquo;s fireside, meanwhile, Doctor Feeder would have been
better entertained; for the younger of the English pair prided
herself, after several months of New York, on understanding
everything that was said, on interpreting every sound, no matter
from what lips the monstrous mystery fell.&nbsp; But Lady Agatha
was never at home; she had learned to describe herself perfectly
by the time she wrote her mother that she was always on the
go.&nbsp; None of the innumerable victims of old-world tyranny
welcomed to the land of freedom had yet offered more lavish
incense to that goddess than this emancipated London
debutante.&nbsp; She had enrolled herself in an amiable band
known by the humorous name of &ldquo;the Tearers&rdquo;&mdash;a
dozen young ladies of agreeable appearance, high spirits and good
wind, whose most general characteristic <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>was that,
when wanted, they were to be sought anywhere in the world but
under the roof supposed to shelter them.&nbsp; They browsed far
from the fold; and when Sidney Feeder, as sometimes happened, met
Lady Agatha at other houses, she was in the hands of the
irrepressible Longstraw.&nbsp; She had come back to her sister,
but Mr. Longstraw had followed her to the door.&nbsp; As to
passing it, he had received direct discouragement from her
brother-in-law; but he could at least hang about and wait for
her.&nbsp; It may be confided to the reader at the risk of
discounting the effect of the only passage in this very level
narrative formed to startle that he never had to wait very
long.</p>
<p>When Jackson Lemon came in his wife&rsquo;s visitors were on
the point of leaving her; and he didn&rsquo;t even ask his
colleague to remain, for he had something particular to say to
Lady Barb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t put to you half the questions I
wanted&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been talking so much to Doctor
Feeder,&rdquo; the dressy Mrs. Chew said, holding the hand of her
hostess in one of her own and toying at one of Lady Barb&rsquo;s
ribbons with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve anything to tell you; I
think I&rsquo;ve told people everything,&rdquo; Lady Barb
answered rather wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told <i>me</i> much!&rdquo; Mrs.
Vanderdecken richly radiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could one tell you?&nbsp; You know
everything,&rdquo; Jackson impatiently laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no&mdash;there are some things that are great
mysteries for me!&rdquo; this visitor promptly pronounced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re coming to me on the
seventeenth,&rdquo; she added to Lady Barb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the seventeenth?&nbsp; I believe we go
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do go to Mrs. Vanderdecken&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chew; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see the cream of the cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Oh gracious!&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderdecken vaguely
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care; she will, won&rsquo;t she,
Doctor Feeder?&mdash;the very pick of American
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Chew stuck to her point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ve no doubt Lady Barb will have a good
time,&rdquo; said Sidney Feeder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
you miss the bran,&rdquo; he went on with irrelevant jocosity to
Jackson&rsquo;s bride.&nbsp; He always tried the jocose when
other elements had failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bran?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jackson&rsquo;s bride
couldn&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you used to ride&mdash;in the Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you speak as if we had met at the
circus,&rdquo; her husband interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t married a mountebank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they put some stuff on the road,&rdquo; Sidney
Feeder explained, not holding much to his joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must miss a great many things,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chew tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what,&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderdecken
tinkled, &ldquo;except the fogs and the Queen.&nbsp; New
York&rsquo;s getting more and more like London.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a pity&mdash;you ought to have known us thirty years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> the queen here,&rdquo; said Jackson
Lemon, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what you know about thirty
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she doesn&rsquo;t go back?&mdash;she goes
back to the last century!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Chew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I should have liked that,&rdquo; said Lady
Barb; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
looked at her husband&mdash;a look she often had&mdash;as if she
vaguely wished him to do something.</p>
<p>He was not called upon, however, to take any violent steps,
for Mrs. Chew presently said, &ldquo;Well, Lady Barb,
good-bye&rdquo;; Mrs. Vanderdecken glared genially and as for
excess of meaning at her hostess and addressed a farewell,
accompanied very audibly <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>with his title, to her host; and
Sidney Feeder made a joke about stepping on the trains of the
ladies&rsquo; dresses as he accompanied them to the door.&nbsp;
Mrs. Chew had always a great deal to say at the last; she talked
till she was in the street and then she addressed that
prospect.&nbsp; But at the end of five minutes Jackson Lemon was
alone with his wife, to whom he then announced a piece of
news.&nbsp; He prefaced it, however, by an inquiry as he came
back from the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Agatha, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; In the streets
somewhere, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to know a little more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I know about things here?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
given her up.&nbsp; I can do nothing with her.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to go back to England,&rdquo; Jackson said
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought never to have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not my proposal, God knows!&rdquo; he sharply
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma could never know what it really is,&rdquo; his
wife more quietly noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t been as yet what your mother
supposed!&nbsp; The man Longstraw wants to marry her and has made
a formal proposal.&nbsp; I met him half an hour ago in Madison
Avenue, and he asked me to come with him into the Columbia
Club.&nbsp; There, in the billiard-room, which to-day is empty,
he opened himself&mdash;thinking evidently that in laying the
matter before me he was behaving with extraordinary
propriety.&nbsp; He tells me he&rsquo;s dying of love and that
she&rsquo;s perfectly willing to go and live in
Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she is,&rdquo; said Lady Barb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I was convinced it would never do <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>and that at
any rate I could have nothing to say to it.&nbsp; I told him
explicitly in short what I had told him virtually before.&nbsp; I
said we should send Aggie straight back to England, and that if
they had the courage they must themselves broach the question
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall you send her back?&rdquo; asked Lady
Barb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately&mdash;by the very first steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone, like an American girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rough, Barb,&rdquo; Jackson
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall easily find some people&mdash;lots
of them are sailing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take her myself,&rdquo; Lady Barb observed in a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I brought her out&mdash;so I must restore
her to my mother&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had expected this and believed he was prepared for it, but
when it came he found his preparation not complete.&nbsp; He had
no answer to make&mdash;none at least that seemed to him to go to
the point.&nbsp; During these last weeks it had come over him
with a quiet irresistible unmerciful force that Mrs. Dexter Freer
had been right in saying to him that Sunday afternoon in Jermyn
Street, the summer before, that he would find it wasn&rsquo;t so
simple to be an American.&nbsp; Such a character was complicated
in just the measure that she had foretold by the difficulty of
domesticating any wife at all liberally chosen.&nbsp; The
difficulty wasn&rsquo;t dissipated by his having taken a high
tone about it; it pinched him from morning till night, it hurt
him like a misfitting shoe.&nbsp; His high tone had given him
courage when he took the great step; but he began to perceive
that the highest tone in the world couldn&rsquo;t change the
nature of things.&nbsp; His ears tingled as he inwardly noted
that if the Dexter Freers, whom he had thought alike abject in
their hopes and their fears, had been by ill luck spending the
winter in <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>New York, they would have found his predicament as good
fun as they could wish.&nbsp; Drop by drop the conviction had
entered his mind&mdash;the first drop had come in the form of a
word from Lady Agatha&mdash;that if his wife should return to
England she would never again later recross the Atlantic.&nbsp;
That word from the competent source had been the touch from the
outside at which often a man&rsquo;s fear crystallises.&nbsp;
What she would do, how she would resist&mdash;this he
wasn&rsquo;t yet prepared to tell himself; but he felt every time
he looked at her that the beautiful woman he had adored was
filled with a dumb insuperable ineradicable purpose.&nbsp; He
knew that if she should plant herself firm no power on earth
would move her; and her blooming antique beauty and the general
loftiness of her breeding came fast to seem to him but the
magnificent expression of a dense patient ponderous power to
resist.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t light, she wasn&rsquo;t supple,
and after six months of marriage he had made up his mind that she
wasn&rsquo;t intelligent&mdash;in spite of all which she would
elude him.&nbsp; She had married him, she had come into his
fortune and his consideration&mdash;for who was she after all? he
was on occasion so angry as to ask himself, remembering that in
England Lady Claras and Lady Florences were as thick as
blackberries&mdash;but she would have nothing to do, if she could
help it, with his country.&nbsp; She had gone in to dinner first
in every house in the place, but this hadn&rsquo;t satisfied
her.&nbsp; It <i>had</i> been simple to be an American in the
good and easy sense that no one else in New York had made any
difficulties; the difficulties had sprung from the very, the
consummate, make of her, which were after all what he had married
her for, thinking they would be a fine temperamental heritage for
his brood.&nbsp; So they would, doubtless, in the coming years
and after the brood should have appeared; but meanwhile they
interfered with the <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>best heritage of all&mdash;the
nationality of his possible children.&nbsp; She would do indeed
nothing violent; he was tolerably certain of that.&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t return to England without his consent; only when
she should return it would be once for all.&nbsp; His one
possible line, then, was not to take her back&mdash;a position
replete with difficulties, since he had in a manner given his
word; she herself giving none at all beyond the formal promise
murmured at the altar.&nbsp; She had been general, but he had
been specific; the settlements he had made were a part of
that.&nbsp; His difficulties were such as he couldn&rsquo;t
directly face.&nbsp; He must tack in approaching so uncertain a
coast.&nbsp; He said to his wife presently that it would be very
inconvenient for him to leave New York at that moment: she must
remember their plans had been laid for a later move.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t think of letting her make the voyage without him,
and on the other hand they must pack her sister off without
delay.&nbsp; He would therefore make instant inquiry for a
chaperon, and he relieved his irritation by cursing the name and
every other attribute of Herman Longstraw.</p>
<p>Lady Barb didn&rsquo;t trouble herself to denounce this
gentleman; her manner was that of having for a long time expected
the worst.&nbsp; She simply remarked after having listened to her
husband for some minutes in silence: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d quite as
lief she should marry Doctor Feeder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after this he closeted himself for an hour with his
sister-in-law, taking great pains to set forth to her the reasons
why she shouldn&rsquo;t marry her Californian.&nbsp; Jackson was
kind, he was affectionate; he kissed her and put his arm round
her waist, he reminded her that he and she were the best of
friends and that she had always been awfully nice to him:
therefore he counted on her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d break her
mother&rsquo;s heart, she&rsquo;d deserve her father&rsquo;s
curse, and <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>she&rsquo;d get him, Jackson, into a pickle from which
no human power might ever disembroil him.&nbsp; Lady Agatha
listened and cried, she returned his kiss very affectionately and
admitted that her father and mother would never consent to such a
marriage; and when he told her that he had made arrangements that
she should sail for Liverpool, with some charming people, the
next day but one, she embraced him again and assured him she
could never thank him enough for all the trouble he had taken
about her.&nbsp; He flattered himself he had convinced and in
some degree comforted her, and he reflected with complacency that
even should his wife take it into her head Barb would never get
ready to embark for her native land between a Monday and a
Wednesday.&nbsp; The next morning Lady Agatha failed to appear at
breakfast, though as she usually rose very late her absence
excited no immediate alarm.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t rung her bell
and was supposed still to be sleeping.&nbsp; But she had never
yet slept later than mid-day; and as this hour approached her
sister went to her room.&nbsp; Lady Barb then discovered that she
had left the house at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and had
gone to meet Mr. Longstraw at a neighbouring corner.&nbsp; A
little note on the table explained it very succinctly, and put
beyond the power of the Jackson Lemons to doubt that by the time
this news reached them their wayward sister had been united to
the man of her preference as closely as the laws of the State of
New York could bind her.&nbsp; Her little note set forth that as
she knew she should never be permitted to marry him she had
resolved to marry him without permission, and that directly after
the ceremony, which would be of the simplest kind, they were to
take a train for the Far West.</p>
<p>Our record is concerned only with the remote consequences of
this affair, which made of course a <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>great deal of trouble for poor
Jackson.&nbsp; He pursued the fugitives to remote rocky
fastnesses and finally overtook them in California; but he
hadn&rsquo;t the boldness to propose to them to separate, for he
promptly made out that Herman Longstraw was at least as well
married as himself.&nbsp; Lady Agatha was already popular in the
new States, where the history of her elopement, emblazoned in
enormous capitals, was circulated in a thousand newspapers.&nbsp;
This question of the newspapers had been for our troubled friend
one of the most definite results of his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
<i>coup de t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; His first thought had been of
the public prints and his first exclamation a prayer that they
shouldn&rsquo;t get hold of the story.&nbsp; They had, however,
got hold of it with a myriad wildly-waved hands and were
scattering it broadcast over the world.&nbsp; Lady Barb never
caught them in the act&mdash;she succeeded perfectly in not
seeing what she needn&rsquo;t; but an affectionate friend of the
family, travelling at that time in the United States, made a
parcel of some of the leading journals, and sent them to Lord
Canterville.&nbsp; This missive elicited from her ladyship a
letter, addressed to her son-in-law, which shook the young
man&rsquo;s position to the base.&nbsp; The phials of a rank
vulgarity had been opened on the house of Canterville, and the
noble matron demanded that in compensation for the affronts and
injuries heaped upon her family, and bereaved and dishonoured as
she was, she should at least be allowed to look on the face of
her second daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll not, for
very pity, be deaf to such a prayer as that,&rdquo; said Lady
Barb; and though loth to record a second act of weakness on the
part of a man with pretensions to be strong, I may not disguise
the fact that poor Jackson, who blushed dreadfully over the
newspapers and felt afresh as he read them the force of Mrs.
Freer&rsquo;s terrible axiom, poor Jackson paid a <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>visit to
the office of the Cunarders.&nbsp; He said to himself later on
that it was the newspapers that had done it; he couldn&rsquo;t
decently appear to be on their side: they made it so hard to deny
that the country was impossible at a time when one was in need of
all one&rsquo;s arguments.&nbsp; Lady Barb, before sailing,
definitely refused to mention any week or month as the date of
their prearranged return to New York.&nbsp; Very many weeks and
months have elapsed since then, and she gives no sign of coming
back.&nbsp; She will never fix a date.&nbsp; She is much missed
by Mrs. Vanderdecken, who still alludes to her&mdash;still says
the line of the shoulders was superb; putting the statement
pensively in the past tense.&nbsp; Lady Beauchemin and Lady
Marmaduke are much disconcerted; the international project has
not, in their view, received an impetus.</p>
<p>Jackson Lemon has a house in London and he rides in the Park
with his wife, who is as beautiful as the day and who a year ago
presented him with a little girl exhibiting features that he
already scans for the look of race&mdash;whether in hope or in
fear to-day is more than my muse has revealed.&nbsp; He has
occasional scenes with Lady Barb during which the look of race is
very clear in her own countenance; but they never terminate in a
visit to the Cunarders.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s exceedingly restless and
is constantly crossing to the Continent; but he returns with a
certain abruptness, for he hates meeting the Dexter Freers, who
seem to pervade the more comfortable parts of Europe.&nbsp; He
dodges them in every town.&nbsp; Sidney Feeder feels very badly
about him; it&rsquo;s months since Jackson has sent him any
&ldquo;results.&rdquo;&nbsp; The excellent fellow goes very
often, in a consolatory spirit, to see Mrs. Lemon, but has not
yet been able to answer her standing question&mdash;&ldquo;Why
that girl more than another?&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Agatha Longstraw
and her husband arrived a <a name="page126"></a><span

SIEGE OF LONDON</h2>
<h3><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>I</h3>
<p>That solemn piece of upholstery the curtain of the
Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise had fallen upon the first act of
the piece, and our two Americans had taken advantage of the
interval to pass out of the huge hot theatre in company with the
other occupants of the stalls.&nbsp; But they were among the
first to return, and they beguiled the rest of the intermission
with looking at the house, which had lately been cleansed of its
historic cobwebs and ornamented with frescoes illustrative of the
classic drama.&nbsp; In the month of September the audience at
the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais is comparatively thin,
and on this occasion the
drama&mdash;<i>L&rsquo;Aventuri&egrave;re</i> of Emile
Augier&mdash;had no pretensions to novelty.&nbsp; Many of the
boxes were empty, others were occupied by persons of provincial
or nomadic appearance.&nbsp; The boxes are far from the stage,
near which our spectators were placed; but even at a distance
Rupert Waterville was able to appreciate details.&nbsp; He was
fond of appreciating details, and when he went to the theatre he
looked about him a good deal, making use of a dainty but
remarkably powerful glass.&nbsp; He knew that such a course was
wanting in true distinction and that it was indelicate to level
at a lady an instrument often only less injurious in effect than
a double-barrelled pistol; but he was always very curious, and
was sure, in any case, that at that moment, at that antiquated
play&mdash;so he was pleased to qualify the masterpiece of a <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>contemporary&mdash;he shouldn&rsquo;t be observed by
any one he knew.&nbsp; Standing up therefore with his back to the
stage he made the circuit of the boxes while several other
persons near him performed the operation with even greater
coolness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single pretty woman,&rdquo; he remarked at last
to his friend; an observation which Littlemore, sitting in his
place and staring with a bored expression at the new-looking
curtain, received in perfect silence.&nbsp; He rarely indulged in
these optical excursions; he had been a great deal in Paris and
had ceased to vibrate more than a few times a day; he believed
the French capital could have no more surprises for him, though
it had had a good many in former days.&nbsp; Waterville was still
in the stage of surprise; he suddenly expressed this
emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Jove, I beg your pardon, I beg
<i>her</i> pardon!&nbsp; There <i>is</i> after all a woman who
may be called&rdquo;&mdash;he paused a little, inspecting
her&mdash;&ldquo;an approach to a beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How near an approach?&rdquo; Littlemore responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unusual kind&mdash;an indescribable
kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Littlemore was not heeding his answer, but
presently heard himself appealed to.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, I wish
very much you&rsquo;d do me a favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did you a favour in coming here,&rdquo; said
Littlemore.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s insufferably hot, and the
play&rsquo;s like a dinner that has been dressed by the
kitchen-maid.&nbsp; The actors are all
<i>doublures</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply to answer me this: is <i>she</i>
respectable now?&rdquo; Waterville demanded, inattentive to his
friend&rsquo;s epigram.</p>
<p>Littlemore gave a groan, without turning his head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always wanting to know if they&rsquo;re
respectable.&nbsp; What on earth can it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made such mistakes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve lost all
confidence,&rdquo; said poor Waterville, to whom European
civilisation had not ceased to be a novelty and who <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>during the
last six months had found himself confronted with problems for
which his training had little prepared him.&nbsp; Whenever he
encountered a very nice-looking woman he was sure to discover
that she belonged to the class represented by the heroine of M.
Augier&rsquo;s drama; and whenever his attention rested upon a
person of a florid style of attraction there was the strongest
probability that she would turn out a countess.&nbsp; The
countesses often looked so unnaturally cheap and the others
unnaturally expensive.&nbsp; Littlemore distinguished at a
glance; he never made mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply for looking at them it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I
suppose,&rdquo; Waterville ingenuously sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stare at them all alike,&rdquo; Littlemore went on,
still without moving; &ldquo;except indeed when I tell you they
<i>aren&rsquo;t</i> decent&mdash;then your eyes, my dear man,
grow as large as saucers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your judgement&rsquo;s against this lady I promise
never to look at her again.&nbsp; I mean the one in the third box
from the passage, in white, with the red flowers,&rdquo; the
younger man said as Littlemore slowly rose and stood beside
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellow with her is leaning forward.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s he who makes me doubt.&nbsp; Will you have the
glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore looked about him without concentration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, thank you, I can see without staring.&nbsp; The young
man&rsquo;s a very good young man,&rdquo; he presently
reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very indeed, but he&rsquo;s several years younger than
she.&nbsp; Wait till she turns her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned it very soon&mdash;she apparently had been speaking
to the <i>ouvreuse</i>, at the door of the box&mdash;and
presented her face to the public; a fair harmonious face, with
smiling eyes, smiling lips, a low brow ornamented with delicate
rings of black hair and ears marked by the sparkle of diamonds
sufficiently large <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>to be seen across the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais.&nbsp; Littlemore looked at her, then started and
held out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;The glass, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; his friend asked as he directed
the little instrument.</p>
<p>He made no answer; he only looked in silence; then he gave the
glass back.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not
respectable.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he dropped again into his
seat.&nbsp; As Waterville remained standing he added:
&ldquo;Please sit down; I think she saw me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want her to see you?&rdquo; pursued the
interrogator, promptly complying.</p>
<p>Littlemore hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil
her game.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this time the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>
was at an end and the curtain going up.</p>
<p>It had been Waterville&rsquo;s idea that they should go to the
theatre.&nbsp; Littlemore, who was always for not going anywhere,
had recommended that, the evening being lovely, they should
simply sit and smoke at the door of the Grand Caf&eacute; in
comparatively pensive isolation.&nbsp; Nevertheless Waterville
enjoyed the second act even less than he had done the first,
which he thought heavy.&nbsp; He began to wonder whether his
companion would wish to stay to the end; a useless line of
speculation, for now that he had got to the theatre
Littlemore&rsquo;s aversion to change would certainly keep him
from moving.&nbsp; Waterville also wondered what he knew about
the lady in the box.&nbsp; Once or twice he glanced at his
friend, and then was sure the latter wasn&rsquo;t following the
play.&nbsp; He was thinking of something else; he was thinking of
that woman.&nbsp; When the curtain fell again he sat in his
place, making way for his neighbours, as usual, to edge past him,
grinding his knees&mdash;his legs were long&mdash;with their own
protuberances.&nbsp; When the two men were alone in the stalls he
spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I should like to see her again, after
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke in fact as if <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Waterville
might have known all about her.&nbsp; Waterville was conscious of
not doing so, but as there was evidently a good deal to know he
recognised he should lose nothing by exerting some art.&nbsp; So
for the moment he asked no question; he only said: &ldquo;Well,
here&rsquo;s the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore gave him a glance of good-natured compassion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean I want to keep letting <i>that</i> off
at her.&nbsp; I mean I should rather like to see her as I used
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you use to?&rdquo; asked Waterville with no
art now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the back piazza at San Pablo.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as
his comrade, in receipt of this information, only stared he went
on: &ldquo;Come out where we can breathe and I&rsquo;ll tell you
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way to the low and narrow door, more worthy of
a rabbit-hutch than of a great theatre, by which you pass from
the stalls of the Com&eacute;die to the lobby, and as Littlemore
went by first his ingenuous friend behind him could see that he
glanced up at the box in the occupants of which they were
interested.&nbsp; The more interesting of these had her back to
the house; she was apparently just leaving the box, after her
companion; but as she hadn&rsquo;t put on her mantle it was
evident they weren&rsquo;t quitting the theatre.&nbsp;
Littlemore&rsquo;s pursuit of fresh air didn&rsquo;t lead him to
the street; he had passed his arm into Waterville&rsquo;s and
when they reached the fine frigid staircase that ascends to the
public foyer he began silently to mount it.&nbsp; Littlemore was
averse to active pleasures, but his friend reflected that now at
least he had launched himself&mdash;he was going to look for the
lady whom, with a monosyllable, he appeared to have
classified.&nbsp; The young man resigned himself for the moment
to asking no questions, and the two strolled together into the
shining saloon where Houdon&rsquo;s admirable statue of <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Voltaire,
reflected in a dozen mirrors, is gaped at by visitors too
obviously less acute than the genius expressed in those living
features.&nbsp; Waterville knew that Voltaire was witty; he had
read <i>Candide</i> and had already had several opportunities of
appreciating the statue.&nbsp; The foyer was not crowded; only a
dozen groups were scattered over the polished floor, several
others having passed out to the balcony which overhangs the
square of the Palais Royal.&nbsp; The windows were open, the
myriad lights of Paris made the dull summer evening look like an
anniversary or a revolution; a murmur of voices seemed to come
up, and even in the foyer one heard the slow click of the horses
and the rumble of the crookedly-driven fiacres on the hard smooth
street-surface.&nbsp; A lady and a gentleman, their backs to our
friends, stood before the image of the <i>genius loci</i>; the
lady was dressed in white, including a white bonnet.&nbsp;
Littlemore felt in the scene, as so many persons feel it just
there, something of the finest essence of France, and he gave a
significant laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems comical to see her here!&nbsp; The last time
was in New Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New Mexico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At San Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh on the back piazza,&rdquo; said Waterville, putting
things together.&nbsp; He had not been aware of the position of
San Pablo, for if on the occasion of his lately being appointed
to a subordinate diplomatic post in London he had been paying a
good deal of attention to European geography he had rather
neglected that of his own country.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t spoken loud and weren&rsquo;t standing near
her, but suddenly, as if she had heard them, the lady in white
turned round.&nbsp; Her eye caught Waterville&rsquo;s first, and
in that glance he saw that if she was aware of something it
wasn&rsquo;t because they had <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>exceeded but because she had
extraordinary quickness of ear.&nbsp; There was no prompt
recognition in it&mdash;none even when it rested lightly on
George Littlemore.&nbsp; But recognition flashed out a moment
later, accompanied with a delicate increase of colour and a quick
extension of her settled smile.&nbsp; She had turned completely
round; she stood there in sudden friendliness, with parted lips;
with a hand, gloved to the elbow, almost imperiously
offered.&nbsp; She was even prettier than at a distance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; she cried; so loud that every one
in the room appeared to feel personally addressed.&nbsp;
Waterville was surprised; he hadn&rsquo;t been prepared, even
after the mention of the back piazza, to find her of so
unmistakable race.&nbsp; Her companion turned round as she spoke;
he was a fresh lean young man in evening dress; he kept his hands
in his pockets; Waterville was sure he was of race quite
other.&nbsp; He looked very grave&mdash;for such a fair festive
young man&mdash;and gave our two friends, though his height was
not superior to theirs, a narrow vertical glance.&nbsp; Then he
turned back to the statue of Voltaire as if it had been among his
premonitions, after all, that the lady he was attending would
recognise people he didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t even
perhaps care to know.&nbsp; This possibly confirmed slightly
Littlemore&rsquo;s assertion that she wasn&rsquo;t
respectable.&nbsp; The young man was that at least; consummately
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where in the world did you drop from?&rdquo; the
lady inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for some time,&rdquo; Littlemore
said, going forward rather deliberately to shake hands with
her.&nbsp; He took it alertly, yet was more serious than she,
keeping his eye on her own as if she had been just a trifle
dangerous.&nbsp; Such was the manner in which a duly discreet
person would have approached some glossy graceful animal which
had an occasional trick of biting.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Here in Paris, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; here and there&mdash;in Europe
generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s queer I haven&rsquo;t met
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better late than never!&rdquo; said Littlemore.&nbsp;
His smile was a little fixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you look very natural,&rdquo; the lady went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do you&mdash;or very charming&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
same thing,&rdquo; he answered, laughing and evidently wishing to
be easy.&nbsp; It was as if, face to face and after a
considerable lapse of time, he had found her more imposing than
he expected when, in the stalls below, he determined to come and
meet her.&nbsp; As he spoke the young man who was with her gave
up his inspection of Voltaire and faced about listlessly, without
looking at his companion&rsquo;s acquaintances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to introduce you to my friend,&rdquo; she went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Arthur Demesne&mdash;Mr. Littlemore.&nbsp;
Mr. Littlemore&mdash;Sir Arthur Demesne.&nbsp; Sir Arthur
Demesne&rsquo;s an Englishman&mdash;Mr. Littlemore&rsquo;s a
countryman of mine, an old friend.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen him
for years.&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
count&mdash;I wonder you knew me,&rdquo; she continued,
addressing this recovered property.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
fearfully changed.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this was said in a clear gay
tone which was the more audible as she spoke with an odd sociable
slowness.&nbsp; The two men, to do honour to her introduction,
silently exchanged a glance; the Englishman perhaps coloured a
little.&nbsp; He was very conscious of his companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t introduced you to many people yet,&rdquo;
she dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur
Demesne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s queer to see you!&rdquo; she pursued,
with her charming eyes still on Littlemore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed, too&mdash;I can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not where you&rsquo;re concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to find out.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you introduce your friend?&nbsp; I see he&rsquo;s
dying to know me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then when he had proceeded
with this ceremony, <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>which he reduced to its simplest
elements, merely glancing at Rupert Waterville and murmuring his
name, &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t tell him who <i>I</i> am!&rdquo;
the lady cried while the young secretary made her a formal
salutation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t
forgotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore showed her a face intended to express more than
what he had hitherto permitted himself; if its meaning had been
put into words these would have been: &ldquo;Ah, but by which
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered the unspoken question, putting out her hand as
she had done to Littlemore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Happy to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Waterville.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Mrs.
Headway&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard of me.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ve ever been in America you must have heard of
me.&nbsp; Not so much in New York, but in the Western
cities.&nbsp; You <i>are</i> an American?&nbsp; Well then
we&rsquo;re all compatriots&mdash;except Sir Arthur
Demesne.&nbsp; Let me introduce you to Sir Arthur.&nbsp; Sir
Arthur Demesne, Mr. Waterville&mdash;Mr. Waterville, Sir Arthur
Demesne.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Demesne&rsquo;s a member of Parliament:
don&rsquo;t he look young?&rdquo;&nbsp; She waited for no
judgement on this appeal, but suddenly made another as she moved
her bracelets back over long loose gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Mr.
Littlemore, what are you thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking that he must indeed have forgotten her name,
for the one she had pronounced awakened no association.&nbsp; But
he could hardly tell her that.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of
San Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The back piazza at my sister&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Oh
don&rsquo;t; it was too horrid.&nbsp; She has left now.&nbsp; I
believe every one has left.&rdquo;&nbsp; The member of Parliament
drew out his watch with the air of a man who could take no part
in these domestic reminiscences; he appeared to combine a generic
self-possession with a degree of individual shyness.&nbsp; He
said something about its being time they should go back to their
seats, but Mrs. Headway paid no attention to the remark.&nbsp;
Waterville wished <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>her to linger and indeed felt almost as free to examine
her as he had to walk, in a different spirit, round the statue of
the author of <i>Candide</i>.&nbsp; Her low-growing hair, with
its fine dense undulations, was of a shade of blackness that has
now become rare; her complexion had the bloom of a white flower;
her profile, when she turned her head, was as pure and fine as
the outline of a cameo.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know this is their first
theatre,&rdquo; she continued, as if to rise to the
occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this is Voltaire, the celebrated
writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m devoted to the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise&rdquo;&mdash;Waterville rose as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadfully bad house; we didn&rsquo;t hear a
word,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur Demesne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, the sad far boxes!&rdquo; murmured
Waterville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather disappointed,&rdquo; Mrs. Headway went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I want to see what becomes of that
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Clorinde?&nbsp; Oh I suppose they&rsquo;ll
shoot her.&nbsp; They generally shoot the women in French
plays,&rdquo; Littlemore said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will remind me of San Pablo!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, at San Pablo the women did the shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to have killed <i>you</i>!&rdquo;
she returned archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m riddled with wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is very remarkable&rdquo;&mdash;the lady
reverted to Houdon&rsquo;s statue.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
beautifully modelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perhaps reading M. de Voltaire,&rdquo;
Littlemore suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ve purchased his works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not proper reading for ladies,&rdquo;
said the young Englishman severely, offering his arm to his
charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you might have told me before I had bought
them!&rdquo; she exclaimed in exaggerated dismay.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;d buy a
hundred and fifty volumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred and fifty?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only bought
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps two won&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; Littlemore
hopefully contributed.</p>
<p>She darted him a reproachful ray.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what you
mean&mdash;that I&rsquo;m too bad already!&nbsp; Well, bad as I
am you must come and see me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she threw him the
name of her hotel as she walked away with her Englishman.&nbsp;
Waterville looked after the latter with a certain interest; he
had heard of him in London and had seen his portrait in <i>Vanity
Fair</i>.</p>
<p>It was not yet time to go down, in spite of this
gentleman&rsquo;s saying so, and Littlemore and his friend passed
out to the balcony of the foyer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Headway&mdash;Headway?&nbsp; Where the deuce did she get
that name?&rdquo; Littlemore asked as they looked down into the
flaring dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her husband I suppose,&rdquo; his friend
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her husband?&nbsp; From which?&nbsp; The last was
named Beck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many has she had?&rdquo; the younger man inquired,
anxious to hear how it was Mrs. Headway wasn&rsquo;t
respectable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; But it
wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to find out, as I believe
they&rsquo;re all living.&nbsp; She was Mrs. Beck&mdash;Nancy
Beck&mdash;when I knew her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy Beck!&rdquo; cried Waterville, aghast.&nbsp; He
was thinking of her delicate profile, like that of a pretty Roman
empress.&nbsp; There was a great deal to be explained.</p>
<p>Littlemore explained it in a few words before they returned to
their places, admitting indeed that he wasn&rsquo;t yet able to
clear up her present appearance.&nbsp; She was a memory of his
Western days; he had seen her last some six years before.&nbsp;
He had known her very <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>well and in several places; the
circle of her activity was chiefly the South-west.&nbsp; This
activity had been during that time of a vague character, except
in the sense that it was exclusively social.&nbsp; She was
supposed to have a husband, one Philadelphia Beck, the editor of
a Democratic newspaper, the <i>Dakota Sentinel</i>; but
Littlemore had never seen him&mdash;the pair were living
apart&mdash;and it had been the impression at San Pablo that
matrimony, for Mr. and Mrs. Beck, was about played out.&nbsp; He
remembered now to have heard afterwards that she was getting a
divorce.&nbsp; She got divorces very easily, she was so taking in
court.&nbsp; She had got one or two before from a man whose name
he couldn&rsquo;t remember, and there was a legend that even
these were not the first.&nbsp; She had been enormously
divorced!&nbsp; When he first met her in California she called
herself Mrs. Grenville, which he had been given to understand was
not an appellation acquired by matrimony, but her parental name,
resumed after the dissolution of an unfortunate union.&nbsp; She
had had these episodes&mdash;her unions were all
unfortunate&mdash;and had borne half-a-dozen names.&nbsp; She was
a charming woman, especially for New Mexico; but she had been
divorced too often&mdash;it was a tax on one&rsquo;s credulity:
she must have repudiated more husbands than she had married.</p>
<p>At San Pablo she was staying with her sister, whose actual
spouse&mdash;she too had been divorced&mdash;the principal man of
the place, kept a bank (with the aid of a six-shooter), and who
had never suffered Nancy to want for a home during her unattached
periods.&nbsp; Nancy had begun very young; she must be about
thirty-seven to-day.&nbsp; That was all he meant by her not being
respectable.&nbsp; Her chronology was rather mixed; her sister at
least had once told him that there was one winter when she
didn&rsquo;t know herself who was Nancy&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp;
She had gone in <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>mainly for editors&mdash;she esteemed the journalistic
profession.&nbsp; They must all have been dreadful ruffians, for
her own amiability was manifest.&nbsp; It was well known that
whatever she had done she had done in self-defence.&nbsp; In fine
she had done things&mdash;that was the main point now.&nbsp; She
had been as pretty as could still be seen, and as good-natured
and as clever as could likewise be yet measured; she had been
quite the best company in those parts.&nbsp; She was a genuine
product of the wild West&mdash;a flower of the Pacific slope;
ignorant, absurd, crude, but full of pluck and spirit, of natural
intelligence and of a certain intermittent haphazard felicity of
impulse.&nbsp; She used to sigh that she only wanted a
chance&mdash;apparently she had found that now.&nbsp; At one
time, without her, he didn&rsquo;t see how he could have put up
with the life.&nbsp; He had started a cattle-ranch, to which San
Pablo was the nearest town, and he used to ride over to see
her.&nbsp; Sometimes he stayed there a week; then he went to see
her every evening.&nbsp; It was infernally hot; they used to sit
on the back piazza.&nbsp; She was always as attractive and very
nearly as well-dressed as they had just beheld her.&nbsp; As far
as appearance went she might have been transplanted at an
hour&rsquo;s notice from that dusty old settlement to the city by
the Seine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of those barbaric women are wonderful,&rdquo;
Littlemore said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like her, they only want a
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t been in love with her&mdash;there never was
anything of that sort between them.&nbsp; There might have been
of course, but as happened there wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Headway
would have been then the successor of Beck; perhaps there had
been others between.&nbsp; She was in no sort of
&ldquo;society&rdquo;; she only had a local reputation
(&ldquo;the well-known Texan belle,&rdquo; the newspapers called
her&mdash;the other editors, to whom she wasn&rsquo;t married),
though indeed in that spacious <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>civilisation the locality was
large.&nbsp; She knew nothing of the East and to the best of his
belief at that period had never seen New York.&nbsp; Various
things might have happened in those six years, however; no doubt
she had &ldquo;come up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The West was sending us
everything (Littlemore spoke as a New Yorker); no doubt it would
send us at last our brilliant women.&nbsp; The well-known Texan
belle used to look quite over the head of New York; even in those
days she thought and talked of Paris, which there was no prospect
of her knowing: that was the way she had got on in New
Mexico.&nbsp; She had had her ambition, her presentiments; she
had known she was meant for better things.&nbsp; Even at San
Pablo she had prefigured her member of Parliament; every now and
then a wandering Englishman came within her range.&nbsp; They
weren&rsquo;t all Sir Arthurs, like her present acquisition, but
they were usually a change from the editors.&nbsp; What she was
doing with her present acquisition Littlemore was curious to
see.&nbsp; She was certainly&mdash;if he had any capacity for
that state of mind, which was not too apparent&mdash;making the
gentleman happy.&nbsp; She looked very splendid; Headway had
probably made a &ldquo;pile,&rdquo; an achievement not to be
imputed to any of the others.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t accept
money&mdash;he was sure she didn&rsquo;t accept money.&nbsp; With
all of which, on their way back to their seats, Littlemore, whose
tone had been humorous, but with that strain of the pensive which
is inseparable from retrospect, suddenly burst into audible
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;The modelling of statues and the works of
Voltaire!&rdquo; he broke out, recurring to two or three things
she had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s touching to hear her
attempt those flights, for in New Mexico she knew nothing about
modelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t strike me as affected,&rdquo;
Waterville demurred, feeling a vague impulse to view her in
becoming lights.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;Oh no; she&rsquo;s only&mdash;as she
says&mdash;fearfully changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in their places before the play went on again, and
they both gave another glance at Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s box.&nbsp;
She now was leaning back behind the slow movements of her fan and
evidently watching Littlemore as if she had waited to see him
come in.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Demesne sat beside her, rather gloomily
resting a round pink chin upon a high stiff collar; neither of
them seemed to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure she makes him happy?&rdquo; Waterville
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way those people show
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does she go about alone with him at that
rate?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has divorced him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does she want to marry the Baronet?&rdquo;
Waterville went on as if his companion was omniscient.</p>
<p>It amused Littlemore for the moment to appear so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He wants to marry <i>her</i>, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be divorced like the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; this time she has got what she wants,&rdquo;
said Littlemore as the curtain rose.</p>
<p>He suffered three days to elapse before he called at the
H&ocirc;tel Meurice, which she had designated, and we may occupy
this interval in adding a few words to the story we have taken
from his lips.&nbsp; George Littlemore&rsquo;s residence in the
Far West had been of the usual tentative sort&mdash;he had gone
there to replenish a pocket depleted by youthful
extravagance.&nbsp; His first attempts had failed; the days had
pretty well passed when a fortune was to be picked up even by a
young man who might be supposed to have inherited from an
honourable father, lately removed, some of those fine abilities,
mainly dedicated to the importation of tea, to which the elder
Mr. Littlemore was <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>indebted for the power of leaving his son markedly at
ease.&nbsp; Littlemore had dissipated his patrimony and was not
quick to discover his talents, which, restricted chiefly to an
unlimited faculty for smoking and horse-breaking, appeared to lie
in the direction of none of the professions called liberal.&nbsp;
He had been sent to Harvard to have them cultivated, but here
they had taken such a form that repression had been found more
necessary than stimulus&mdash;repression embodied in an
occasional sojourn in one of the lovely villages of the
Connecticut Valley.&nbsp; Rustication saved him perhaps in the
sense that it detached him; it undermined his ambitions, which
had been foolish.&nbsp; At the age of thirty he had mastered none
of the useful arts, unless we include in the number the great art
of indifference.&nbsp; But he was roused from too consistent an
application of it by a stroke of good luck.&nbsp; To oblige a
luckless friend, even in more pressing need of cash than himself,
he had purchased for a moderate sum&mdash;the proceeds of a
successful game of poker&mdash;a share in a silver-mine which the
disposer of it, with unusual candour, admitted to be destitute of
metal.&nbsp; Littlemore looked into his mine and recognised the
truth of the contention, which, however, was demolished some two
years later by a sudden revival of curiosity on the part of one
of the other shareholders.&nbsp; This gentleman, convinced that a
silver-mine without silver is as rare as an effect without a
cause, discovered the sparkle of the precious element deep down
in the reasons of things.&nbsp; The discovery was agreeable to
Littlemore, and was the beginning of a fortune which, through
several dull years and in many rough places, he had repeatedly
despaired of, and which a man whose purpose had never been very
keen, nor his aim very high, didn&rsquo;t perhaps altogether
deserve.</p>
<p>It was before he saw himself successful that he <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>had made
the acquaintance of the lady now established at the H&ocirc;tel
Meurice.&nbsp; To-day he owned the largest share in his mine,
which had remained perversely productive and enabled him to buy,
among other things, in Montana, a cattle-ranch of higher type
than the dry acres near San Pablo.&nbsp; Ranches and mines
encourage security, and the consciousness of not having to watch
the sources of his income too anxiously&mdash;a tax on ideal
detachment which spoils the idea&mdash;now added itself to his
usual coolness.&nbsp; It was not that this same coolness
hadn&rsquo;t been considerably tried.&nbsp; To take only
one&mdash;the principal&mdash;instance: he had lost his wife
after only a twelvemonth of marriage, some three years before the
date at which we meet him.&nbsp; He had been turned thirty-eight
when he distinguished and wooed and won an ardent girl of
twenty-three, who, like himself, had consulted all the
probabilities in expecting a succession of happy years.&nbsp; She
had left him a small daughter, now entrusted to the care of his
only sister, the wife of an English squire and mistress of a dull
park in Hampshire.&nbsp; This lady, Mrs. Dolphin by name, had
captivated her landowner during a journey in which Mr. Dolphin
had promised himself to examine the institutions of the United
States.&nbsp; The institution on which he had reported most
favourably was the pretty girls of the larger towns, and he had
returned to New York a year or two later to marry Miss
Littlemore, who, unlike her brother, had not wasted her
patrimony.&nbsp; Her sister-in-law, married several years later
and coming to Europe on this occasion, had died in
London&mdash;where she had flattered herself the doctors were
infallible&mdash;a week after the birth of her little girl; and
poor Littlemore, though relinquishing his child for the moment,
had lingered on the scene of his deep disconcertment to be within
call of the Hampshire nursery.&nbsp; He was a presence to <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>attract
admiring attention, especially since his hair and moustache had
turned to so fine a silver.&nbsp; Tall and clean-limbed, with a
good figure and a bad carriage, he looked capable but indolent,
and was exposed to imputations of credit and renown, those
attaching to John Gilpin, of which he was far from being either
conscious or desirous.&nbsp; His eye was at once keen and quiet,
his smile dim and dilatory, but perfectly sincere.&nbsp; His
principal occupation to-day was doing nothing, and he did it with
a beautiful consistency.&nbsp; This exercise excited real envy on
the part of Rupert Waterville, who was ten years younger and who
had too many ambitions and anxieties&mdash;none of them very
important, but making collectively a considerable
incubus&mdash;to be able to wait for inspiration.&nbsp; He
thought of it as the last social grace, he hoped some day to
arrive at it; it made a man so independent&mdash;he had his
resources within his own breast.&nbsp; Littlemore could sit for a
whole evening without utterance or movement, smoking cigars and
looking absently at his finger-nails.&nbsp; As every one knew him
for a good fellow who had made his fortune this free and even
surface offered by him to contact couldn&rsquo;t be attributed to
stupidity or moroseness.&nbsp; It seemed to imply a fund of
reminiscence, an experience of life that had left him hundreds of
things to think about.&nbsp; Waterville felt that if he himself
could make a good use of these present years and keep a sharp
lookout for experience he too at forty-four might have time to
look at his finger-nails.&nbsp; He cultivated the conceit that
such contemplations&mdash;not of course in their literal but in
their symbolic intensity&mdash;were a sign of a man of the
world.&nbsp; Waterville, reckoning possibly without an ungrateful
Department of State, also nursed the fond fancy that he had
embraced the diplomatic career.&nbsp; He was the junior of the
two secretaries who render the <i>personnel</i> <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of the
United States Legation in London exceptionally numerous, and was
at present enjoying his annual leave of absence.&nbsp; It became
a diplomatist to be inscrutable, and though he had by no means,
as a whole, taken Littlemore for his model&mdash;there were much
better ones in the diplomatic body accredited to the Court of
Saint James&rsquo;s&mdash;he thought the right effect of fine
ease suggested when of an evening, in Paris, after one had been
asked what one would like to do, one replied that one would like
to do nothing, and simply sat for an interminable time in front
of the Grand Caf&eacute; on the Boulevard de la Madeleine (one
was very fond of caf&eacute;s) ordering a succession of
<i>demi-tasses</i>.&nbsp; It was seldom Littlemore cared even to
go to the theatre, and the visit to the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise, which we have described, had been undertaken at
Waterville&rsquo;s instance.&nbsp; He had seen <i>Le
Demi-Monde</i> a few nights before and had been told that
<i>L&rsquo;Aventuri&egrave;re</i> would show him a particular
treatment of the same subject&mdash;the justice to be meted out
to compromised women who attempt to thrust themselves into
honourable families.&nbsp; It seemed to him that in both of these
cases the ladies had deserved their fate, but he wished it might
have been brought about by a little less lying on the part of the
representatives of honour.&nbsp; Littlemore and he, without being
intimate, were very good friends and spent much of their time
together.&nbsp; As it turned out Littlemore was grateful for the
chance that had led him to a view of this new incarnation of
Nancy Beck.</p>
<h3><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>II</h3>
<p>His delay in going to see her was nevertheless calculated;
there were more reasons for it than we need at once go
into.&nbsp; When he did go, however, Mrs. Headway was at home and
he was scarce surprised to find Sir Arthur Demesne in her
sitting-room.&nbsp; There was something in the air that spoke of
the already ample stretch of this gentleman&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp;
Littlemore thought probable that, given the circumstances, he
would now bring it to a close; he must have learned from their
hostess that this welcomed compatriot was an old and familiar
friend.&nbsp; He might of course have definite rights&mdash;he
had every appearance of it, but the more they were rooted the
more gracefully he could afford to waive them.&nbsp; Littlemore
made these reflexions while the friend in possession faced him
without sign of departure.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway was very
gracious&mdash;she had ever the manner of having known you a
hundred years; she scolded Littlemore extravagantly for not
having been to see her sooner, but this was only a form of the
gracious.&nbsp; By daylight she looked a little faded, but there
was a spirit in her that rivalled the day.&nbsp; She had the best
rooms in the hotel and an air of extreme opulence and prosperity;
her courier sat outside, in the antechamber, and she evidently
knew how to live.&nbsp; She attempted to include Sir Arthur in
the conversation, but though the young man remained in his place
he failed to <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>grasp the offered perch.&nbsp; He followed but as from
the steep bank of the stream, where yet he was evidently not at
his ease.&nbsp; The conversation therefore remained
superficial&mdash;a quality that of old had by no means belonged
to Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s interviews with her friends.&nbsp; The
Englishman hovered with a distant air which Littlemore at first,
with a good deal of private amusement, simply attributed to
jealousy.</p>
<p>But after a time Mrs. Headway spoke to the point.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear Sir Arthur, I wish very much you&rsquo;d
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The member of Parliament got up and took his hat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought I should oblige you by staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To defend me against Mr. Littlemore?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
known him since I was a baby&mdash;I know the worst he can
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She fixed her charming smile on her retreating
visitor and added with much unexpectedness: &ldquo;I want to talk
to him about my past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to hear,&rdquo; said Sir
Arthur, with his hand on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to talk American; you wouldn&rsquo;t
understand us!&nbsp; He speaks in the English style,&rdquo; she
explained in her little sufficient way as the Baronet, who
announced that at all events he would come back in the evening,
let himself out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know about your past?&rdquo;
Littlemore inquired, trying not to make the question sound
impertinent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I&rsquo;ve told him everything; but he
doesn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; One has to hold an Englishman by
the head, you know, and kind of force it down.&nbsp; He has never
heard of a woman being&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But here Mrs. Headway
checked herself, while Littlemore filled out the blank.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t
matter,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;there are more things in the
world than those people have heard of.&nbsp; However, I like them
very much; at least I like <i>him</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s such a
regular gentleman; do you know what I <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>mean?&nbsp; Only, as he stays too
long and he ain&rsquo;t amusing, I&rsquo;m very glad to see you
for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean I&rsquo;m not a regular gentleman?&rdquo;
Littlemore asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed; you used to be out there.&nbsp; I think you
were the only one&mdash;and I hope you are still.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why I recognised you the other night&mdash;I might
have cut you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can still, if you like.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s not what I want.&nbsp; I want you
to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Headway fixed her eyes for a moment on the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you suppose that man is there still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The member of Parliament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean Max.&nbsp; Max is my courier,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Headway with some impressiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;in that case I should have to give him an
order, and I don&rsquo;t know what in the world to ask him to
do.&nbsp; He sits there for hours; with my simple habits I afford
him no employment.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve no grand
imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burden of grandeur!&rdquo; said Littlemore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m very grand for clothes and
things.&nbsp; But on the whole I like it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only
afraid he&rsquo;ll hear.&nbsp; I talk so very loud.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;m trying to get
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to be different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because everything else is so,&rdquo; Mrs.
Headway bravely pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you hear that I had
lost my husband?&rdquo; she went on abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;a&mdash;Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo; and
Littlemore paused with an effect that didn&rsquo;t seem to come
home to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Mr. Headway,&rdquo; she said with dignity.&nbsp;
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through a good deal since you
saw me last: marriage and death and trouble and all sorts of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had been through a good deal of marriage before
that,&rdquo; her old friend ventured to observe.</p>
<p>She rested her eyes on him with extravagant intensity and
without a change of colour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so much, not so
much!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as might have been thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as was reported.&nbsp; I forget whether I
was married when I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of the reports,&rdquo; said
Littlemore.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I never saw Mr. Beck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t lose much; he was too mean to
live.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done certain things in my life that
I&rsquo;ve never understood; no wonder others can&rsquo;t do much
with them.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s all over!&nbsp; Are you sure
Max doesn&rsquo;t hear?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all sure.&nbsp; But if you suspect him of
listening at the keyhole I&rsquo;d send him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he does that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
always rushing to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he doesn&rsquo;t hear.&nbsp; I had no idea you had
so many secrets.&nbsp; When I parted with you Mr. Headway was in
the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now he&rsquo;s in the past.&nbsp; He was a
pleasant man&mdash;I can understand my doing that.&nbsp; But he
only lived a year.&nbsp; He had neuralgia of the heart; he left
me very well off.&rdquo;&nbsp; She mentioned these various facts
as if they were quite of the same order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear <i>that</i>.&nbsp; You used to
have expensive tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty of money,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Headway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Headway had property at Denver, which
has increased immensely in value.&nbsp; After his death I tried
New York.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t take much stock in New
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; Littlemore&rsquo;s hostess spoke these last
words in a tone that reeked of some strong experience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>mean to live in Europe.&nbsp; I guess I can do with
Europe,&rdquo; she stated; and the manner of it had the touch of
prophecy, as the other proposition had had the echo of
history.</p>
<p>Littlemore was much struck with all this; he was greatly
enlivened by Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re
travelling with that young man?&rdquo; he pursued, with the
coolness of a person who wishes to make his entertainment go as
far as possible.</p>
<p>She folded her arms as she leaned back in her chair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Littlemore; I&rsquo;m about as
sweet-tempered as I used to be in America, but I know a great
deal more.&nbsp; Of course I ain&rsquo;t travelling with that
young man.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s only a good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a good lover?&rdquo; Littlemore
ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do people travel&mdash;publicly&mdash;with their
lovers?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to laugh at me&mdash;I want
you to help me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her appeal might, in its almost
childish frankness, have penetrated; she recognised his
wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I tell you, I&rsquo;ve taken a great
fancy to this grand old Europe; I feel as if I should never go
back.&nbsp; But I want to see something of the life.&nbsp; I
think it would suit me&mdash;if I could get started a
little.&nbsp; George Littlemore,&rdquo; she added in a
moment&mdash;&ldquo;I may as well be <i>real</i>, for I
ain&rsquo;t at all ashamed.&nbsp; I want to get into
society.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He settled himself in his chair with the feeling of a man who,
knowing that he will have to pull, seeks to obtain a certain
leverage.&nbsp; It was in a tone of light jocosity, almost of
encouragement, however, that he repeated: &ldquo;Into
society?&nbsp; It seems to me you&rsquo;re in it already, with
the big people over here for your adorers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to know&mdash;if they
<i>are</i> big,&rdquo; she promptly said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is a
Baronet much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re apt to think.&nbsp; But I know very
little about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you in society yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Never in the world!&nbsp; Where did you get
that idea?&nbsp; I care no more about society than about
Max&rsquo;s buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s countenance assumed for a moment a look
of extreme disappointment, and Littlemore could see that, having
heard of his silver-mine and his cattle-ranch, and knowing that
he was living in Europe, she had hoped to find him eminent in the
world of fashion.&nbsp; But she speedily took heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&nbsp; You know
you&rsquo;re a real gentleman&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a gentleman, but I&rsquo;ve none of the habits
of one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Littlemore had a pause and then added:
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve sat too much on back
piazzas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed quickly; she instantly understood&mdash;understood
even more than he had meant to say.&nbsp; But she wished to make
use of him, and it was of more importance that she should appear
forgiving&mdash;especially as she had the happy consciousness of
being so&mdash;than that she should punish a cruel speech.&nbsp;
She would be wise, however, to recognise everything.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That makes no difference&mdash;a gentleman&rsquo;s always
a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, not the way a lady&rsquo;s always a lady!&rdquo; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, talking of ladies, it&rsquo;s unnatural that,
through your sister, you shouldn&rsquo;t know something about
European society,&rdquo; said Mrs. Headway.</p>
<p>At the mention of his sister, made with a studied lightness of
reference which he caught as it passed, Littlemore was unable to
repress a start.&nbsp; &ldquo;What in the world have you to do
with my sister?&rdquo; he would have liked to say.&nbsp; The
introduction of this relative was disagreeable to him; she
belonged quite to another order of ideas, and it was out of the
question Mrs. Headway should ever make her <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>acquaintance&mdash;if this was what, as the latter
would have said, she was &ldquo;after.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he took
advantage of a side issue.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by
European society?&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t talk about that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s an empty phrase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean English society; I mean the society your
sister lives in; that&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; said his
hostess, who was quite prepared to be definite.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mean the people I saw in London last May&mdash;the people I saw
at the opera and in the park, the people who go to the
Queen&rsquo;s drawing-rooms.&nbsp; When I was in London I stayed
at that hotel on the corner of Piccadilly&mdash;the one looking
straight down Saint James&rsquo;s Street&mdash;and I spent hours
together at the window there looking at the people in the
carriages.&nbsp; I had a carriage of my own, and when I
wasn&rsquo;t at my window I was riding all around.&nbsp; I was
all alone; I saw every one, but I knew no one&mdash;I had no one
to tell me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know Sir Arthur then&mdash;I
only met him a month ago at Homburg.&nbsp; He followed me to
Paris&mdash;that&rsquo;s how he came to be my guest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Serenely, prosaically, without a breath of the inflation of
vanity, she made this last assertion: it was as if she were used
to being followed or as if a gentleman one met at Homburg would
inevitably follow.&nbsp; In the same tone she went on: &ldquo;I
attracted a good deal of attention in London&mdash;I could easily
see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do that wherever you go,&rdquo; Littlemore
said&mdash;insufficiently enough, as he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to attract so much; I think
it&rsquo;s vulgar.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke as if she liked to use
the word.&nbsp; She was evidently open to new sources of
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one was looking at you the other night at the
theatre,&rdquo; Littlemore continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you
hope to escape notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to escape notice.&nbsp; People have
always looked at me and I guess they always will.&nbsp; But there
are different ways of being looked at, and I <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>know the
way I want.&nbsp; I mean to have it too!&rdquo; Mrs. Headway
prettily shrilled.&nbsp; Yes, she was full of purpose.</p>
<p>He sat there face to face with her and for some time said
nothing.&nbsp; He had a mixture of feelings, and the memory of
other places, other hours, was stealing over him.&nbsp; There had
been of old a very considerable absence of interposing surfaces
between these two&mdash;he had known her as one knew people only
amid the civilisation of big tornadoes and back piazzas.&nbsp; He
had liked her extremely in a place where it would have been
ridiculous to be difficult to please.&nbsp; But his sense of this
fact was somehow connected with other and such now alien facts;
his liking for Nancy Beck was an emotion of which the sole
setting was a back piazza.&nbsp; She presented herself here on a
new basis&mdash;she appeared to want to be classified
afresh.&nbsp; Littlemore said to himself that this was too much
trouble; he had taken her at the great time in that way&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t begin at this late hour to take her in another
way.&nbsp; He asked himself if she were going to be a real
bore.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t easy to suppose her bent on ravage,
but she might become tiresome if she were too disposed to be
different.&nbsp; It made him rather afraid when she began to talk
about European society, about his sister, to pronounce things
vulgar.&nbsp; Littlemore was naturally merciful and decently
just; but there was in his composition an element of the
indolent, the sceptical, perhaps even the brutal, which made him
decidedly prefer the simplicity of their former terms of
intercourse.&nbsp; He had no particular need to see a woman rise
again, as the mystic process was called; he didn&rsquo;t believe
in women&rsquo;s rising again.&nbsp; He believed in their not
going down, thought it perfectly possible and eminently
desirable; but held it was much better for society that the
divisions, the categories, the differing <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>values,
should be kept clear.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t believe in bridging
the chasms, in muddling the kinds.&nbsp; In general he
didn&rsquo;t pretend to say what was good for
society&mdash;society seemed to him rather in a bad way; but he
had a conviction on this particular point.&nbsp; Nancy Beck going
in for the great prizes, that spectacle might be entertaining for
a simple spectator; but it would be a nuisance, an embarrassment,
from the moment anything more than detached &ldquo;fun&rdquo;
should represent his share.&nbsp; He had no wish to be
&ldquo;mean,&rdquo; but it might be well to show her he
wasn&rsquo;t to be humbugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh if there&rsquo;s anything you want you&rsquo;ll have
it,&rdquo; he said in answer to her last remark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always had what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want something new this time.&nbsp; Does your
sister reside in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady, what do you know about my sister?&rdquo;
Littlemore asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a woman
you&rsquo;d care in the least for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His old friend had a marked pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t really respect me!&rdquo; she then abruptly and
rather gaily cried.&nbsp; It had one of her &ldquo;Texan&rdquo;
effects of drollery; so that, yes, evidently, if he wished to
preserve the simplicity of their former intercourse she was
willing to humour him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Mrs. Beck&mdash;!&rdquo; he vaguely
protested, using her former name quite by accident.&nbsp; At San
Pablo he&mdash;and apparently she&mdash;had never thought whether
he respected her or not.&nbsp; That never came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a proof of it&mdash;calling me by that
hateful name!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe I&rsquo;m
married?&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t been fortunate in my names,&rdquo;
she pensively added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it very awkward when you say such mad
things.&nbsp; My sister lives most of the year in the country;
she&rsquo;s very simple, rather dull, perhaps <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>a trifle
narrow-minded.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re very clever, very lively, and
as large and loose and free as all creation.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
why I think you wouldn&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed to run down your sister!&rdquo;
Mrs. Headway made prompt answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You told me
once&mdash;at San Pablo&mdash;that she was the nicest woman you
knew.&nbsp; I made a note of that, you see.&nbsp; And you told me
she was just my age.&nbsp; So that makes it rather inglorious for
you if you won&rsquo;t introduce me!&rdquo;&nbsp; With which she
gave a laugh that perhaps a little heralded danger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least afraid of her being dull.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s just refined and nice, to be
dull.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ever so much too exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed, ever so much!&nbsp; But nothing is more
easy than to know my sister,&rdquo; said Littlemore, who knew
perfectly that what he said was untrue.&nbsp; And then as a
diversion from this delicate topic he brought out: &ldquo;Are you
going to marry Sir Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve been married about
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but this is a new line, it would be
different.&nbsp; An Englishman&mdash;that&rsquo;s a new
sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I <i>should</i> marry it would be a European,&rdquo;
she said judiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your chance is very good&mdash;they&rsquo;re all
marrying Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have to be some one fine, the man I should
marry now.&nbsp; I have a good deal to make up, you know.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I want to learn about Sir Arthur.&nbsp; All
this time you haven&rsquo;t told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing in the world to
tell&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never heard of him.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t he
told you himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all; he&rsquo;s very modest.&nbsp; He
doesn&rsquo;t brag nor &lsquo;blow&rsquo; nor make himself out
anything great.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I like him for: I think
it&rsquo;s in such good taste.&nbsp; I do love good taste!&rdquo;
said Mrs. <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Headway.&nbsp; &ldquo;But all this time,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t told me you&rsquo;d help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no one here, you
know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can help me by not preventing me.&nbsp; I want you
to promise not to prevent me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She continued to give
him her charming conscious eyes, which seemed to look far into
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, how could I prevent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not quite sure of how.&nbsp; But you
might try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m too lazy and too stupid,&rdquo; Littlemore
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, musing as she still looked at
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re too stupid.&nbsp; But I
think you&rsquo;re also too kind,&rdquo; she added more
graciously.&nbsp; She was almost irresistible when she said such
a thing as that.</p>
<p>They talked for a quarter of an hour longer, and at
last&mdash;as if she had had scruples&mdash;she spoke to him of
his own marriage, of the death of his wife, matters to which she
alluded more felicitously (as he thought) than to some other
points.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve a little girl you ought to
be very happy; that&rsquo;s what I should like to have.&nbsp;
Lord, I should make her a nice woman!&nbsp; Not like me&mdash;in
another style!&rdquo;&nbsp; When he rose to leave her she made a
great point of his coming again&mdash;she was to be some weeks
longer in Paris.&nbsp; And he must bring Mr. Waterville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your English friend won&rsquo;t like that&mdash;our
coming very often,&rdquo; Littlemore reminded her as he stood
with his hand on the door.</p>
<p>But she met this without difficulty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what he has to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&nbsp; Only he must be in love with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give him any right.&nbsp; Mercy, if
I had <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>had to put myself out for all the men that have been in
love with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;d have had a terrible life.&nbsp;
Even doing as you please you&rsquo;ve had rather an agitated
one,&rdquo; Littlemore pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;But your young
Englishman&rsquo;s sentiments appear to give him the right to sit
there, after one comes in, looking blighted and bored.&nbsp; That
might become very tiresome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment he becomes tiresome I send him away.&nbsp;
You can trust me for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it doesn&rsquo;t matter after all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
friend was perfectly conscious that nothing would suit him less
than to have undisturbed possession of Mrs. Headway.</p>
<p>She came out with him into the antechamber.&nbsp; Mr. Max, the
courier, was fortunately not there.&nbsp; She lingered a little;
she appeared to have more to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the contrary he
likes you to come,&rdquo; she then continued; &ldquo;he wants to
study my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To study them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to find out about me, and he thinks they may
tell him something.&nbsp; Some day he&rsquo;ll ask you right out
&lsquo;What sort of a woman is she anyway?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he found out yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Headway, surveying the front of her dress.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
never seen any one like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should imagine not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;ll just try to find out from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then he <i>shall</i> find out,&rdquo; Littlemore
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell him you&rsquo;re the
most charming woman in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t a description!&nbsp; Besides, he knows
it.&nbsp; He wants to know if I&rsquo;m respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he fuss about it?&rdquo; Littlemore
asked&mdash;not at once.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>She
grew a little pale; she seemed to be watching his lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, mind you tell him all right,&rdquo; she went on,
with her wonderful gay glare, the strain of which yet brought
none of her colour back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respectable?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re
adorable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood a moment longer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re no
use!&rdquo; she rather harshly wailed.&nbsp; And she suddenly
turned away and passed back into her sitting-room, with the heavy
rustle of her far-trailing skirts.</p>
<h3><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Elle ne doute de rien!&rdquo; Littlemore said to
himself as he walked away from the hotel; and he repeated the
phrase in talking about her to Waterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wants
to be right,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;ll never
really succeed.&nbsp; She has begun too late, she&rsquo;ll never
get on the true middle of the note.&nbsp; However, she
won&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;s wrong, so it doesn&rsquo;t
signify!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he more or less explained what he meant
by this discrimination.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d remain in certain
essentials incurable.&nbsp; She had no delicacy; no discretion;
no shading; she was a woman who suddenly said to you, &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t really respect me!&rdquo;&nbsp; As if that were a
thing for a woman to say!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon what she meant by it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Waterville could always imagine alternatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more she meant by it the less she ought to say
it!&rdquo; Littlemore declared.</p>
<p>But he returned to the H&ocirc;tel Meurice and on the next
occasion took this companion with him.&nbsp; The secretary of
legation, who had not often been in close quarters with pretty
women whose respectability, or whose lack of it, was so frankly
discussable, was prepared to find the well-known Texan belle a
portentous type.&nbsp; He was afraid there might be danger in
her, but on the whole he felt armed.&nbsp; The object of his
devotion at present was his country, or at least the Department
of State; he had no intention of <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>being diverted from that
allegiance.&nbsp; Besides, he had his ideal of the attractive
woman&mdash;a person pitched in a very much lower key than this
shining, smiling, rustling, chattering daughter of the
Territories.&nbsp; The woman he should care for would have
repose, a sense of the private in life, and the implied, even the
withheld, in talk; would sometimes let one alone.&nbsp; Mrs.
Headway was personal, familiar, intimate, perpetually appealing
or accusing, demanding explanations and pledges, saying things
one had to answer.&nbsp; All this was accompanied with a hundred
smiles and radiations and other natural graces, but the general
effect was distinctly fatiguing.&nbsp; She had certainly a great
deal of charm, an immense desire to please, and a wonderful
collection of dresses and trinkets; but she was eager and
clamorous, and it was hard for other people to be put to serve
her appetite.&nbsp; If she wanted to get into society there was
no reason why those of her visitors who had the luck to be
themselves independent, to be themselves placed, and to be
themselves by the same token critical, should wish to see her
there; for it was this absence of common social encumbrances made
her drawing-room attractive.&nbsp; There was no doubt whatever
that she was several women in one, and she ought to content
herself with that sort of numerical triumph.&nbsp; Littlemore
said to Waterville that it was stupid of her to wish to scale the
heights; she ought to know how much more she was in her element
scouring the plain.&nbsp; She appeared vaguely to irritate him;
even her fluttering attempts at self-culture&mdash;she had become
a great judge of books and pictures and plays, and pronounced
off-hand&mdash;constituted a vague invocation, an appeal for
sympathy onerous to a man who disliked the trouble of revising
old decisions consecrated by a certain amount of reminiscence
that might be called tender.&nbsp; She exerted, however,
effectively enough one of the <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>arts of solicitation&mdash;she often
startled and surprised.&nbsp; Even Waterville felt a touch of the
unexpected, though not indeed an excess of it, to belong to his
conception of the woman who should have an ideal repose.&nbsp; Of
course there were two kinds of surprises, and only one of them
thoroughly pleasant, though Mrs. Headway dealt impartially in
both.&nbsp; She had the sudden delights, the odd exclamations,
the queer curiosities of a person who has grown up in a country
where everything is new and many things ugly, and who, with a
natural turn for the arts and amenities of life, makes a tardy
acquaintance with some of the finer usages, the higher
pleasures.&nbsp; She was provincial; it was easy to see how she
embodied that term; it took no great cleverness.&nbsp; But what
was Parisian enough&mdash;if to be Parisian was the measure of
success&mdash;was the way she picked up ideas and took a hint
from every circumstance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only give me time and I
guess I&rsquo;ll come out all right,&rdquo; she said to
Littlemore, who watched her progress with a mixture of admiration
and regret.&nbsp; She delighted to speak of herself as a poor
little barbarian grubbing up crumbs of knowledge, and this habit
borrowed beautiful relief from her delicate face, her so highly
developed dress and the free felicity of her manners.</p>
<p>One of her surprises was, that after that first visit she said
no more to Littlemore about Mrs. Dolphin.&nbsp; He did her
perhaps the grossest injustice, but he had quite expected her to
bring up this lady whenever they met.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
she&rsquo;ll only leave Agnes alone she may do what she
will,&rdquo; he said to Waterville, expressing his
satisfaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister would never look at her, and
it would be very awkward to have to tell her so.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
counted on aid; she made him feel this simply by the way she
looked at him; but for the moment she demanded no definite
service.&nbsp; She held her tongue but waited, and her patience
itself was a deeper <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>admonition.&nbsp; In the way of
society, it had to be noted, her privileges were meagre, Sir
Arthur Demesne and her two compatriots being, so far as the
latter could discover, her only visitors.&nbsp; She might have
had other friends, but she held her head very high and liked
better to see no one than not to see the best company.&nbsp; She
went in, clearly, for producing the effect of being by no means
so neglected as fastidious.&nbsp; There were plenty of Americans
in Paris, but in this direction she failed to extend her
acquaintance; the nice people wouldn&rsquo;t come to her, and
nothing would have induced her to receive the others.&nbsp; She
had a perfect and inexorable view of those she wished to
avoid.&nbsp; Littlemore expected her every day to ask why he
didn&rsquo;t bring some of his friends&mdash;as to which he had
his answer ready.&nbsp; It was rather a poor one, for it
consisted but of the &ldquo;academic&rdquo; assurance that he
wished to keep her for himself.&nbsp; She would be sure to retort
that this was &ldquo;too thin,&rdquo; as indeed it was; yet the
days went by without her calling him to account.&nbsp; The little
American colony in Paris abounded in amiable women, but there
were none to whom Littlemore could make up his mind to say that
it would be a favour to him they should call on Mrs.
Headway.&nbsp; He shouldn&rsquo;t like them the better for doing
so, and he wished to like those of whom he might ask a
favour.&nbsp; Except, therefore, that he occasionally spoke of
her as a full-blown flower of the West, still very pretty, but of
not at all orthodox salon scent, who had formerly been a great
chum of his, she remained unknown in the circles of the Avenue
Gabriel and the streets that encircle the Arch of Triumph.&nbsp;
To ask the men to go see her without asking the ladies would only
accentuate the fact that he didn&rsquo;t ask the ladies; so he
asked no one at all.&nbsp; Besides, it was true&mdash;just a
little&mdash;that he wished to keep her to himself, and he was
fatuous enough <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>to believe she really cared more for him than for any
outsider.&nbsp; Of course, however, he would never dream of
marrying her, whereas her Englishman apparently was capable of
that quaintness.&nbsp; She hated her old past; she often made
that point, talking of this &ldquo;dark backward&rdquo; as if it
were an appendage of the same order as a thieving cook or a noisy
bedroom or even an inconvenient protrusion of drapery.&nbsp;
Therefore, as Littlemore was part of the very air of the previous
it might have been supposed she would hate him too and wish to
banish him, with all the images he recalled, from her
sight.&nbsp; But she made an exception in his favour, and if she
disliked their early relations as a chapter of her own history
she seemed still to like them as a chapter of his.&nbsp; He felt
how she clung to him, how she believed he could make a great and
blest difference for her and in the long run would.&nbsp; It was
to the long run that she appeared little by little to have
attuned herself.</p>
<p>She succeeded perfectly in maintaining harmony between Sir
Arthur Demesne and her American visitors, who spent much less
time in her drawing-room.&nbsp; She had easily persuaded him that
there were no grounds for jealousy and that they had no wish, as
she said, to crowd him out; for it was ridiculous to be jealous
of two persons at once, and Rupert Waterville, after he had
learned the way to her favour and her fireside, presented himself
as often as his original introducer.&nbsp; The two indeed usually
came together and they ended by relieving their competitor of a
part of the weight of his problem.&nbsp; This amiable and earnest
but slightly fatuous young man, who had not yet made up his mind,
was sometimes rather oppressed with the magnitude of the
undertaking, and when alone with Mrs. Headway occasionally found
the tension of his thoughts quite painful.&nbsp; He was very slim
and straight and looked taller than his height; <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>he had the
prettiest silkiest hair, which waved away from a large white
forehead, and he was endowed with a nose of the so-called Roman
model.&nbsp; He looked, in spite of these attributes, younger
than his years, partly on account of the delicacy of his
complexion and the almost child-like candour of his round blue
eyes.&nbsp; He was diffident and self-conscious; there were
certain letters he couldn&rsquo;t pronounce.&nbsp; At the same
time he carried himself as one brought up to fill a considerable
place in the world, with whom confidence had become a duty and
correctness a habit, and who, though he might occasionally be a
little awkward about small things, would be sure to acquit
himself honourably in great ones.&nbsp; He was very simple and
believed himself very serious; he had the blood of a score of
Warwickshire squires in his veins, mingled in the last instance
with the somewhat paler fluid still animating the long-necked
daughter of a banker who, after promising himself high glories as
a father-in-law, had by the turn of events been reduced to
looking for them in Sir Baldwin Demesne.&nbsp; The boy who was
the only fruit of that gentleman&rsquo;s marriage had come into
his title at five years of age; his mother, who was somehow
parentally felt to have a second time broken faith with
expectation by not having better guarded the neck of her husband,
broken in the hunting-field, watched over him with a tenderness
that burned as steadily as a candle shaded by a transparent
hand.&nbsp; She never admitted even to herself that he was not
the cleverest of men; but it took all her own cleverness, which
was much greater, to maintain this appearance.&nbsp; Fortunately
he wasn&rsquo;t wild, so that he would never marry an actress or
a governess, like two or three of the young men who had been at
Eton with him.&nbsp; With this ground of nervousness the less
Lady Demesne awaited with a proud patience his appointment to
some high office.&nbsp; <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>He represented in Parliament the
Conservative instincts and vote of a red-roofed market town, and,
sending regularly to his bookseller for the new publications on
economical subjects, was determined his political development
should have a massive statistical basis.&nbsp; He was not
conceited; he was only misinformed&mdash;misinformed, I mean,
about himself.&nbsp; He thought himself essential to the
propriety of things&mdash;not as an individual, but as an
institution.&nbsp; This conviction indeed was too sacred to
betray itself by vulgar assumptions.&nbsp; If he was a little man
in a big place he never strutted nor talked loud; he merely felt
it as a luxury that he had a large social circumference.&nbsp; It
was like sleeping in a big bed; practically one didn&rsquo;t toss
about the more, but one felt a greater freshness.</p>
<p>He had never seen anything like Mrs. Headway; he hardly knew
by what standard to measure her.&nbsp; She was not at all the
English lady&mdash;not one of those with whom he had been
accustomed to converse; yet it was impossible not to make out in
her a temper and a tone.&nbsp; He might have been sure she was
provincial, but as he was much under her charm he compromised by
pronouncing her only foreign.&nbsp; It was of course provincial
to be foreign; but this was after all a peculiarity which she
shared with a great many nice people.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t wild,
and his mother had flattered herself that in this all-important
matter he wouldn&rsquo;t be perverse; yet it was far from regular
that he should have taken a fancy to an American widow, five
years older than himself, who knew no one and who sometimes
didn&rsquo;t appear to understand exactly who he was.&nbsp;
Though he believed in no alternative to the dignity of the
British consciousness, it was precisely her foreignness that
pleased him; she seemed as little as possible of his own race and
creed; there wasn&rsquo;t a touch of Warwickshire in her
composition.&nbsp; She was <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>like an Hungarian or a Pole, with
the difference that he could almost make out her speech.&nbsp;
The unfortunate young man was engulfed even while not admitting
that he had done more than estimate his distance to the
brink.&nbsp; He would love wisely&mdash;one might even so love
agreeably.&nbsp; He had intelligently arranged his life; he had
determined to marry at thirty-two.&nbsp; A long line of ancestors
was watching him; he hardly knew what they would think of Mrs.
Headway.&nbsp; He hardly knew what he thought himself; the only
thing he was absolutely sure of was that she made the time pass
as it passed in no other pursuit.&nbsp; That, indeed, rather
worried him; he was by no means sure anything so precious should
be so little accounted for.&nbsp; There was nothing so to account
but the fragments of Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s conversation, the
peculiarities of her accent, the sallies of her wit, the
audacities of her fancy, the odd echoes of her past.&nbsp; Of
course he knew she had had a past; she wasn&rsquo;t a young girl,
she was a widow&mdash;and widows were essentially the expression
of an accomplished fact.&nbsp; He was not jealous of her
antecedents, but he would have liked a little to piece them
together, and it was here the difficulty occurred.&nbsp; The
subject was illumined with fitful flashes, but never placed
itself before him as a general picture.&nbsp; He asked her
various questions, but her answers were so startling that, like
sudden luminous points, they seemed to intensify the darkness
round their edges.&nbsp; She had apparently spent her life in a
remote province of a barbarous country, but it didn&rsquo;t
follow from this that she herself had been low.&nbsp; She had
been a lily among thistles, and there was something romantic
possibly in the interest taken by a man of his position in a
woman of hers.&nbsp; It pleased Sir Arthur to believe he was
romantic; that had been the case with several of his ancestors,
who supplied a precedent without which <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>he would
scarce perhaps have ventured to trust himself.&nbsp; He was the
victim of perplexities from which a single spark of direct
perception would have saved him.&nbsp; He took everything in the
literal sense; a grain of humour or of imagination would have
saved him, but such things were never so far from him as when he
had begun to stray helplessly in the realm of wonder.&nbsp; He
sat there vaguely waiting for something to happen and not
committing himself by rash declarations.&nbsp; If he was in love
it was in his own way, reflectively, inexpressibly,
obstinately.&nbsp; He was waiting for the formula which would
justify his conduct and Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s peculiarities.&nbsp;
He hardly knew where it would come from; you might have thought
from his manner that he would discover it in one of the elaborate
<i>entre&eacute;s</i> that were served to the pair when she
consented to dine with him at Bignon&rsquo;s or the Caf&eacute;
Anglais; or in one of the luxurious band-boxes that arrived from
the Rue de la Paix and from which she often lifted the lid in the
presence of her admirer.&nbsp; There were moments when he got
weary of waiting in vain, and at these moments the arrival of her
American friends&mdash;he often asked himself why she had so
few&mdash;seemed to lift the mystery from his shoulders and give
him a chance to rest.&nbsp; This apology for a plan she herself
might yet scarce contribute to, since she couldn&rsquo;t know how
much ground it was expected to cover.&nbsp; She talked about her
past because she thought it the best thing to do; she had a
shrewd conviction that it was somehow better made use of and
confessed to, even in a manner presented or paraded, than caused
to stretch behind her as a mere nameless desert.&nbsp; She could
at least a little irrigate and plant the waste.&nbsp; She had to
have some geography, though the beautiful blank rose-coloured
map-spaces of unexplored countries were what she would have
preferred.&nbsp; She had no <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>objection to telling fibs, but now
that she was taking a new departure wished to indulge only in
such as were imperative.&nbsp; She would have been delighted
might she have squeezed through with none at all.&nbsp; A few,
verily, were indispensable, and we needn&rsquo;t attempt to scan
too critically the more or less adventurous excursions into
poetry and fable with which she entertained and mystified Sir
Arthur.&nbsp; She knew of course that as a product of fashionable
circles she was nowhere, but she might have great success as a
child of nature.</p>
<h3><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>IV</h3>
<p>Rupert Waterville, in the midst of intercourse in which every
one perhaps had a good many mental reserves, never forgot that he
was in a representative position, that he was official and
responsible; and he asked himself more than once how far he was
sure it was right, as they said in Boston, to countenance Mrs.
Headway&rsquo;s claim to the character even of the American lady
thrown to the surface by the late inordinate spread of
excavation.&nbsp; In his own way as puzzled as poor Sir Arthur,
he indeed flattered himself he was as particular as any
Englishman could be.&nbsp; Suppose that after all this free
association the well-known Texan belle should come over to London
and ask at the Legation to be presented to the Queen?&nbsp; It
would be so awkward to refuse her&mdash;of course they would have
to refuse her&mdash;that he was very careful to make no tacit
promises.&nbsp; She might construe anything as a tacit
promise&mdash;he knew how the smallest gestures of diplomatists
were studied and interpreted.&nbsp; It was his effort, therefore,
to be really diplomatic in his relations with this attractive but
dangerous woman.&nbsp; The party of four used often to dine
together&mdash;Sir Arthur pushed his confidence so far&mdash;and
on these occasions their fair friend, availing herself of one of
the privileges of a <i>femme du monde</i> even at the most
expensive restaurant, used to wipe her glasses with her
napkin.&nbsp; One evening when after polishing a <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>goblet she
held it up to the light, giving it, with her head on one side,
the least glimmer of a wink, he noted as he watched her that she
looked like a highly modern bacchante.&nbsp; He observed at this
moment that the Baronet was gazing at her too, and wondered if
the same idea had come to him.&nbsp; He often wondered what the
Baronet thought; he had devoted first and last a good deal of
attention to the psychology of the English &ldquo;great
land-owning&rdquo; consciousness.&nbsp; Littlemore, alone, at
this moment, was characteristically detached; he never appeared
to watch Mrs. Headway, though she so often watched him.&nbsp;
Waterville asked himself among other things why Sir Arthur
hadn&rsquo;t brought his own friends to see her, for Paris during
the several weeks that now elapsed abounded in English
visitors.&nbsp; He guessed at her having asked him and his having
refused; he would have liked particularly to know if she had
asked him.&nbsp; He explained his curiosity to Littlemore, who,
however, took very little interest in it.&nbsp; Littlemore
expressed nevertheless the conviction that she <i>would</i> have
asked him; she never would be deterred by false delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been very delicate with <i>you</i>,&rdquo;
Waterville returned to this.&nbsp; &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been
at all pressing of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only because she has given me up.&nbsp; She
thinks I&rsquo;m a brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she thinks of me,&rdquo; Waterville
pensively said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she counts upon you to introduce her to the
American Minister at the Court of Saint James&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Littlemore opined without mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky
for you our representative here&rsquo;s absent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Minister has settled two or three difficult
questions and I suppose can settle this one.&nbsp; I shall do
nothing but by the orders of my chief.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very
fond of alluding to his chief.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;She does me injustice,&rdquo; Littlemore added
in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to several people
about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but what have you told them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she lives at the H&ocirc;tel Meurice and wants to
know nice people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re flattered, I suppose, at your thinking
them nice, but they don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Waterville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke of her to Mrs. Bagshaw, and Mrs. Bagshaw has
promised to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Waterville murmured; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
call Mrs. Bagshaw nice!&nbsp; Mrs. Headway won&rsquo;t take up
with Mrs. Bagshaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s exactly what she
wants&mdash;to be able to cut some one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville had a theory that Sir Arthur was keeping Mrs.
Headway as a surprise&mdash;he meant perhaps to produce her
during the next London season.&nbsp; He presently, however,
learned as much about the matter as he could have desired to
know.&nbsp; He had once offered to accompany his beautiful
compatriot to the Museum of the Luxembourg and tell her a little
about the modern French school.&nbsp; She had not examined this
collection, in spite of her resolve to see everything
remarkable&mdash;she carried her &ldquo;Murray&rdquo; in her lap
even when she went to see the great tailor in the Rue de la Paix,
to whom, as she said, she had given no end of points&mdash;for
she usually went to such places with Sir Arthur, who was
indifferent to the modern painters of France.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
says there are much better men in England.&nbsp; I must wait for
the Royal Academy next year.&nbsp; He seems to think one can wait
for anything, but I&rsquo;m not so good at waiting as he.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t afford to wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ve waited long
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much as this Mrs. Headway said on the
occasion of her arranging with Rupert Waterville that they should
some day visit the Luxembourg together.&nbsp; She <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>alluded to
the Englishman as if he were her husband or her brother, her
natural protector and companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she knows how that sounds?&rdquo;
Waterville again throbbingly brooded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe she would do it if she knew how it sounds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he also drew the moral that when one was a well-known Texan
belle there was no end to the things one had to learn: so marked
was the difference between being well-known and being
well-bred.&nbsp; Clever as she was, Mrs. Headway was right in
saying she couldn&rsquo;t afford to wait.&nbsp; She must learn,
she must live quickly.&nbsp; She wrote to Waterville one day to
propose that they should go to the Museum on the morrow; Sir
Arthur&rsquo;s mother was in Paris, on her way to Cannes, where
she was to spend the winter.&nbsp; She was only passing through,
but she would be there three days, and he would naturally give
himself up to her.&nbsp; She appeared to have the properest ideas
as to what a gentleman would propose to do for his mother.&nbsp;
She herself, therefore, should be free, and she named the hour at
which she should expect him to call for her.&nbsp; He was
punctual to the appointment, and they drove across the river in a
large high-hung barouche in which she constantly rolled about
Paris.&nbsp; With Mr. Max on the box&mdash;the courier sported
enormous whiskers&mdash;this vehicle had an appearance of great
respectability, though Sir Arthur assured her (what she repeated
to her other friends) that in London next year they would do the
thing much better for her.&nbsp; It struck her other friends, of
course, that this backer was prepared to go very far; which on
the whole was what Waterville would have expected of him.&nbsp;
Littlemore simply remarked that at San Pablo she drove herself
about in a ramshackle buggy with muddy wheels and a mule very
often in the shafts.&nbsp; Waterville throbbed afresh as he asked
himself if the mother of a Tory M.P. would really consent to know
her.&nbsp; She <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>must of course be aware that it was a woman who was
keeping her son in Paris at a season when English gentlemen were
most naturally employed in shooting partridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s staying at the H&ocirc;tel du Rhin, and
I&rsquo;ve made him feel that he mustn&rsquo;t leave her while
she&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Mrs. Headway said as they drove up the
narrow Rue de Seine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Lady Demesne,
but her full title&rsquo;s the Honourable Lady Demesne, as
she&rsquo;s a Baron&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Her father used to be
a banker, but he did something or other for the
Government&mdash;the Tories, you know they call them&mdash;and so
he was raised to the peerage.&nbsp; So you see one <i>can</i> be
raised!&nbsp; She has a lady with her as a
companion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Waterville&rsquo;s neighbour gave him
this information with a seriousness that made him smile; he tried
to measure the degree to which it wouldn&rsquo;t have occurred to
her that he didn&rsquo;t know how a Baron&rsquo;s daughter was
addressed.&nbsp; In that she was truly provincial; she had a way
of exaggerating the value of her intellectual acquisitions and of
assuming that others had shared her darkness.&nbsp; He noted,
too, that she had ended by suppressing poor Sir Arthur&rsquo;s
name altogether and designating him only by a sort of conjugal
pronoun.&nbsp; She had been so much and so easily married that
she was full of these misleading references to gentlemen.</p>

<p>They walked through the gallery of the Luxembourg, and, except
that Mrs. Headway directed her beautiful gold
<i>face-&agrave;-main</i> to everything at once and to nothing
long enough, talked, as usual, rather too loud and bestowed too
much attention on the bad copies and strange copyists that formed
a circle round several indifferent pictures, she was an agreeable
companion and a grateful recipient of &ldquo;tips.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She was quick to understand, and Waterville was sure that before
she left the gallery she had made herself mistress of a new
subject and was quite prepared to compare the French school
critically with the London exhibitions of the following
year.&nbsp; As he had remarked more than once with Littlemore,
she did alternate in the rummest stripes.&nbsp; Her conversation,
her personality, were full of little joints and seams, all of
them very visible, where the old and the new had been pieced and
white-threaded together.&nbsp; When they had passed through the
different rooms of the palace Mrs. Headway proposed that instead
of returning directly they should take a stroll in the adjoining
gardens, which she wished very much to see and was sure she
should like.&nbsp; She had quite seized the difference between
the old Paris and the new, and felt the force of the romantic
associations of the Latin quarter as perfectly as if she had
enjoyed all the benefits of modern culture.&nbsp; The autumn sun
was warm in the alleys and terraces <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>of the Luxembourg; the masses of
foliage above them, clipped and squared, rusty with ruddy
patches, shed a thick lacework over the white sky, which was
streaked with the palest blue.&nbsp; The beds of flowers near the
palace were of the vividest yellow and red, and the sunlight
rested on the smooth grey walls of those parts of its basement
that looked south; in front of which, on the long green benches,
a row of brown-cheeked nurses, in white caps and white aprons,
sat yielding sustenance to as many bundles of white
drapery.&nbsp; There were other white caps wandering in the broad
paths, attended by little brown French children; the small
straw-seated chairs were piled and stacked in some places and
disseminated in others.&nbsp; An old lady in black, with white
hair fastened over each of her temples by a large black comb, sat
on the edge of a stone bench (too high for her delicate length)
motionless, staring straight before her and holding a large
door-key; under a tree a priest was reading&mdash;you could see
his lips move at a distance; a young soldier, dwarfish and
red-legged, strolled past with his hands in his pockets, which
were very much distended.&nbsp; Waterville sat down with Mrs.
Headway on the straw-bottomed chairs and she presently said:
&ldquo;I like this&mdash;it&rsquo;s even better than the pictures
in the gallery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more of a picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in France is a picture&mdash;even things
that are ugly,&rdquo; Waterville replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything
makes a subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like France!&rdquo; she summed up with a small
incongruous sigh.&nbsp; Then suddenly, from an impulse more
conceivably allied to such a sound, she added: &ldquo;He asked me
to go and see her, but I told him I wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She may
come and see me if she likes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was so abrupt
that Waterville was slightly confounded; then he saw she had
returned by a short cut to Sir Arthur Demesne and his <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>honourable
mother.&nbsp; Waterville liked to know about other people&rsquo;s
affairs, yet didn&rsquo;t like this taste to be imputed to him;
and therefore, though much desiring to see how the old lady, as
he called her, would treat his companion, he was rather
displeased with the latter for being so confidential.&nbsp; He
had never assumed he was so intimate with her as that.&nbsp; Mrs.
Headway, however, had a manner of taking intimacy for
granted&mdash;a manner Sir Arthur&rsquo;s mother at least
wouldn&rsquo;t be sure to like.&nbsp; He showed for a little no
certainty of what she was talking about, but she scarcely
explained.&nbsp; She only went on through untraceable
transitions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The least she can do is to come.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been very kind to her son.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not a
reason for my going to her&mdash;it&rsquo;s a reason for her
coming to me.&nbsp; Besides, if she doesn&rsquo;t like what
I&rsquo;ve done she can leave me alone.&nbsp; I want to get into
European society, but I want to do so in my own way.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to run after people; I want them to run after
me.&nbsp; I guess they will, some day!&rdquo;&nbsp; Waterville
listened to this with his eyes on the ground; he felt himself
turn very red.&nbsp; There was something in such crudities on the
part of the ostensibly refined that shocked and mortified him,
and Littlemore had been right in speaking of her lack of the
<i>nuance</i>.&nbsp; She was terribly distinct; her motives, her
impulses, her desires glared like the lighted signs of
caf&eacute;s-concerts.&nbsp; She needed to keep on view, to hand
about, like a woman with things to sell on an hotel-terrace, her
precious intellectual wares.&nbsp; Vehement thought, with Mrs.
Headway, was inevitably speech, though speech was not always
thought, and now she had suddenly become vehement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If she does once come&mdash;then, ah then, I shall be too
perfect with her; I shan&rsquo;t let her go!&nbsp; But she must
take the first step.&nbsp; I confess I hope she&rsquo;ll be
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Waterville
perversely.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if she
ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He has never told me anything about her; never
a word about any of his own belongings.&nbsp; If I wished I might
believe he&rsquo;s ashamed of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I know what it is.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just regular European refinement.&nbsp; He
doesn&rsquo;t want to show off; he&rsquo;s too much of a
gentleman.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t want to dazzle me&mdash;he
wants me to like him for himself.&nbsp; Well, I do like
him,&rdquo; she added in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I shall like
him still better if he brings his mother.&nbsp; They shall know
that in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will make an impression in
America?&rdquo; Waterville amusedly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will show I&rsquo;m visited by the British
aristocracy.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t love that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they grudge you no innocent pleasure,&rdquo; the
young man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grudged me common politeness&mdash;when I was in
New York!&nbsp; Did you ever hear how they treated me when I came
on from my own section?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville stared; this episode was quite new to him.&nbsp;
His companion had turned toward him; her pretty head was tossed
back like a flower in the wind; there was a flush in her cheek, a
more questionable charm in her eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, my dear New
Yorkers, they&rsquo;re incapable of rudeness!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of them, I see.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t speak of the men.&nbsp; The men were well
enough&mdash;though they did allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow what, Mrs. Headway?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was quite
thrillingly in the dark.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t answer at once; her eyes, glittering a
little, were fixed on memories still too vivid.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
did you hear about me over there?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t pretend you
heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had heard nothing at all; there had not been a <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>word about
Mrs. Headway in New York.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t pretend and he
was obliged to tell her this.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been
away,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and in America I didn&rsquo;t go
out.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to go out for in New
York&mdash;only insipid boys and girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of spicy old women, who settled I was
a bad bold thing.&nbsp; They found out I was in the
&lsquo;gay&rsquo; line.&nbsp; They discovered I was known to the
authorities.&nbsp; I <i>am</i> very well known all out
West&mdash;I&rsquo;m known from Chicago to San Francisco; if not
personally, at least by reputation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m known to all
classes.&nbsp; People can tell you out there.&nbsp; In New York
they decided I wasn&rsquo;t good enough.&nbsp; Not good enough
for New York!&nbsp; What do you say to that?&rdquo;&mdash;it rang
out for derision.&nbsp; Whether she had struggled with her pride
before making her avowal her confidant of this occasion never
knew.&nbsp; The strange want of dignity, as he felt, in her
grievance seemed to indicate that she had no pride, and yet there
was a sore spot, really a deep wound, in her heart which, touched
again, renewed its ache.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took a house for the
winter&mdash;one of the handsomest houses in the place&mdash;but
I sat there all alone.&nbsp; They thought me &lsquo;gay,&rsquo;
<i>me</i> gay there on Fifty-Eighth Street without so much as a
cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville was embarrassed; diplomatist as he was he hardly
knew what line to take.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t see the need or
the propriety of her overflow; though the incident appeared to
have been most curious and he was glad to know the facts on the
best authority.&nbsp; It was the first he did know of this
remarkable woman&rsquo;s having spent a winter in his native
city&mdash;which was virtually a proof of her having come and
gone in complete obscurity.&nbsp; It was vain for him to pretend
he had been a good deal away, for he had been appointed to his
post in London only six months before, and Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s
social failure ante-dated <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>that event.&nbsp; In the midst of
these reflexions he had an inspiration.&nbsp; He attempted
neither to question, to explain nor to apologise; he ventured
simply to lay his hand for an instant on her own and to exclaim
as gallantly as possible: &ldquo;I wish <i>I</i> had
known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had plenty of men&mdash;but men don&rsquo;t
count.&nbsp; If they&rsquo;re not a positive help they&rsquo;re a
hindrance, so that the more you have the worse it looks.&nbsp;
The women simply turned their backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were afraid of you&mdash;they were jealous,&rdquo;
the young man produced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to try and patch it up; all
I know is that not one of them crossed my threshold.&nbsp; No,
you needn&rsquo;t try and tone it down; I know perfectly how the
case stands.&nbsp; In New York, if you please, I didn&rsquo;t
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the worse for New York!&rdquo; cried
Waterville, who, as he afterwards said to Littlemore, had got
quite worked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you know why I want to get into society over
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; She jumped up and stood before him; with a dry
hard smile she looked down at him.&nbsp; Her smile itself was an
answer to her question; it expressed a sharp vindictive
passion.&nbsp; There was an abruptness in her movements which
left her companion quite behind; but as he still sat there
returning her glance he felt he at last in the light of that
smile, the flash of that almost fierce demand, understood Mrs.
Headway.</p>
<p>She turned away to walk to the gate of the garden, and he went
with her, laughing vaguely and uneasily at her tragic tone.&nbsp;
Of course she expected him to serve, all obligingly, all
effectively, her rancour; but his female relations, his mother
and his sisters, his innumerable cousins, had been a party to the
slight she had suffered, and he reflected as he walked along that
after all they had been right.&nbsp; They had been <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>right in
not going to see a woman who could chatter that way about her
social wrongs; whether she were respectable or not they had had
the true assurance she&rsquo;d be vulgar.&nbsp; European society
might let her in, but European society had its limpness.&nbsp;
New York, Waterville said to himself with a glow of civic pride,
was quite capable of taking a higher stand in such a matter than
London.&nbsp; They went some distance without speaking; at last
he said, expressing honestly the thought at that moment uppermost
in his mind: &ldquo;I hate that phrase, &lsquo;getting into
society.&rsquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think one ought to attribute
to one&rsquo;s self that sort of ambition.&nbsp; One ought to
assume that one&rsquo;s <i>in</i> the confounded thing&mdash;that
one <i>is</i> society&mdash;and to hold that if one has good
manners one has, from the social point of view, achieved the
great thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;The best company&rsquo;s where I
am,&rsquo; any lady or gentleman should feel.&nbsp; The rest can
take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she appeared not to understand, then she broke
out: &ldquo;Well, I suppose I haven&rsquo;t good manners; at any
rate I&rsquo;m not satisfied!&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t talk
right&mdash;I know that very well.&nbsp; But let me get where I
want to first&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll look after the details.&nbsp;
If I once get there I shall be perfect!&rdquo; she cried with a
tremor of passion.&nbsp; They reached the gate of the garden and
stood a moment outside, opposite the low arcade of the
Od&eacute;on, lined with bookstalls, at which Waterville cast a
slightly wistful glance, waiting for Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s
carriage, which had drawn up at a short distance.&nbsp; The
whiskered Max had seated himself within and, on the tense elastic
cushions, had fallen into a doze.&nbsp; The carriage got into
motion without his waking; he came to his senses only as it
stopped again.&nbsp; He started up staring and then without
confusion proceeded to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned it in Italy&mdash;they call it the
<i>siesta</i>,&rdquo; <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>he remarked with an agreeable smile,
holding the door open to Mrs. Headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think you had and they might!&rdquo;
this lady replied, laughing amicably as she got into the vehicle,
where Waterville placed himself beside her.&nbsp; It was not a
surprise to him that she spoiled her courier; she naturally would
spoil her courier.&nbsp; But civilisation begins at home, he
brooded; and the incident threw an ironic light on her desire to
get into society.&nbsp; It failed, however, to divert her
thoughts from the subject she was discussing with her friend, for
as Max ascended the box and the carriage went on its way she
threw out another note of defiance.&nbsp; &ldquo;If once
I&rsquo;m all right over here I guess I can make New York do
something!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see the way those women will
squirm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville was sure his mother and sisters wouldn&rsquo;t
squirm; but he felt afresh, as the carriage rolled back to the
H&ocirc;tel Meurice, that now he understood Mrs. Headway.&nbsp;
As they were about to enter the court of the hotel a closed
carriage passed before them, and while a few moments later he
helped his companion to alight he saw that Sir Arthur Demesne had
stepped from the other vehicle.&nbsp; Sir Arthur perceived Mrs.
Headway and instantly gave his hand to a lady seated in the
coup&eacute;.&nbsp; This lady emerged with a certain slow
impressiveness, and as she stood before the door of the
hotel&mdash;a woman still young and fair, with a good deal of
height, gentle, tranquil, plainly dressed, yet distinctly
imposing&mdash;it came over our young friend that the Tory member
had brought <i>his</i> principal female relative to call on Nancy
Beck.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s triumph had begun; the dowager
Lady Demesne had taken the first step.&nbsp; Waterville wondered
whether the ladies in New York, notified by some magnetic wave,
were beginning to be convulsed.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway, quickly
conscious of what <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>had happened, was neither too prompt to appropriate the
visit nor too slow to acknowledge it.&nbsp; She just paused,
smiling at Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to introduce my mother&mdash;she wants
very much to know you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He approached Mrs. Headway;
the lady had taken his arm.&nbsp; She was at once simple and
circumspect; she had every resource of the English matron.</p>
<p>Mrs. Headway, without advancing a step, put out a hand as if
to draw her quickly closer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare you&rsquo;re
too sweet!&rdquo; Waterville heard her say.</p>
<p>He was turning away, as his own business was over; but the
young Englishman, who had surrendered his companion, not to say
his victim, to the embrace, as it might now almost be called, of
their hostess, just checked him with a friendly gesture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I daresay I shan&rsquo;t see you again&mdash;I&rsquo;m
going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye then,&rdquo; said Waterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
return to England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I go to Cannes with my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remain at Cannes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till Christmas very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies, escorted by Mr. Max, had passed into the hotel,
and Waterville presently concluded this exchange.&nbsp; He smiled
as he walked away, making it analytically out that poor Sir
Arthur had obtained a concession, in the domestic sphere, only at
the price of a concession.</p>
<p>The next morning he looked up Littlemore, from whom he had a
standing invitation to breakfast, and who, as usual, was smoking
a cigar and turning over a dozen newspapers.&nbsp; Littlemore had
a large apartment and an accomplished cook; he got up late and
wandered about his rooms all the morning, stopping from time to
time to look out of his windows, which overhung the Place de la
Madeleine.&nbsp; They had not been seated many minutes at
breakfast when the <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>visitor mentioned that Mrs. Headway was about to be
abandoned by her friend, who was going to Cannes.</p>
<p>But once more he was to feel how little he might ever
enlighten this comrade.&nbsp; &ldquo;He came last night to bid me
good-bye,&rdquo; Littlemore said.</p>
<p>Again Waterville wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very civil of him,
then, all of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come from civility&mdash;he came from
curiosity.&nbsp; Having dined here he had a pretext for
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope his curiosity was satisfied,&rdquo; our young
man generously dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suspect not.&nbsp; He sat here some time, but
we talked only about what he didn&rsquo;t want to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what <i>did</i> he want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I know anything against Nancy Beck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he call her Nancy
Beck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never mentioned her; but I saw what he was after and
that he quite yearned to lead up to her.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor man!&rdquo; Waterville sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you pity him,&rdquo; said
Littlemore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Beck&rsquo;s admirers were never
pitied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course he wants to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do it then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve nothing to say to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He believes there&rsquo;s something about her,
somewhere in time or space, that may make a pretty big
mouthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him leave it alone then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he if he&rsquo;s really
hit?&rdquo;&mdash;Waterville spoke as from sad experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, he must settle it himself.&nbsp; He
has no right at any rate to put me such a question.&nbsp; There
was a moment, just as he was going, when he had it on his
tongue&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; He stood there in the doorway, he
couldn&rsquo;t leave me&mdash;he was going to <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>plump out
with it.&nbsp; He looked at me straight, and I looked straight at
him; we remained that way for almost a minute.&nbsp; Then he
decided not, on the whole, to risk it and took himself
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville assisted at this passage with intense
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if he had asked you, what would you
have said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;d have said that his question
wasn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been tantamount to admitting the
worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Waterville brooded again, &ldquo;you
couldn&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp; On the other hand if he had put it
to you on your honour whether she&rsquo;s a woman to marry it
would have been very awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awkward enough.&nbsp; Luckily he has no business to put
things to me on my honour.&nbsp; Moreover, nothing has passed
between us to give him the right to ask me <i>any</i> questions
about Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; As she&rsquo;s a great friend of mine
he can&rsquo;t pretend to expect me to give confidential
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s a woman to marry, all
the same,&rdquo; Waterville returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if a man
were to try to corner you on it you might knock him down, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t be an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to serve,&rdquo; said Littlemore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are cases where a man must lie nobly,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>Waterville looked grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;What cases?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where a woman&rsquo;s honour&rsquo;s at
stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s of course if he
has been himself concerned with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Himself or another.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it does matter.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like false
swearing,&rdquo; said Waterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
delicate question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the arrival of the servant <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>with a
second course, and Littlemore gave a laugh as he helped
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be a lark to see her married to
that superior being!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Responsibility or not, it would be very
amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, then, to give her a leg up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid! But I mean to bet on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville gave his companion a serious glance; he thought him
strangely superficial.&nbsp; The alternatives looked all
formidable, however, and he sighed as he laid down his fork.</p>
<h3><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>VI</h3>
<p>The Easter holidays that year were unusually genial; mild
watery sunshine assisted the progress of the spring.&nbsp; The
high dense hedges, in Warwickshire, were like walls of hawthorn
embedded in banks of primrose, and the finest trees in England,
springing out of them with a regularity which suggested
conservative principles, began more densely and downily to
bristle.&nbsp; Rupert Waterville, devoted to his duties and
faithful in attendance at the Legation, had had little time to
enjoy the rural hospitality that shows the English, as he had
promptly learned to say, at their best.&nbsp; Freshly yet not
wildly exotic he had repeatedly been invited to grace such
scenes, but had had hitherto to practise with reserve the great
native art of &ldquo;staying.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cultivated method
and kept the country-houses in reserve; he would take them up in
their order, after he should have got a little more used to
London.&nbsp; Without hesitation, however, he had accepted the
appeal from Longlands; it had come to him in a simple and
familiar note from Lady Demesne, with whom he had no
acquaintance.&nbsp; He knew of her return from Cannes, where she
had spent the whole winter, for he had seen it related in a
Sunday newspaper; yet it was with a certain surprise that he
heard from her in these informal terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear Mr.
Waterville, my son tells me you will perhaps be able to come down
here on the seventeenth to spend two <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>or three days.&nbsp; If you can it
will give us much pleasure.&nbsp; We can promise you the society
of your charming countrywoman Mrs. Headway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had seen Mrs. Headway; she had written him, a fortnight
before from an hotel in Cork Street, to say she had arrived in
London for the season and should be happy to see him.&nbsp; He
had called on her, trembling with the fear that she would break
ground about her presentation at Court; but he was agreeably
surprised by her overlooking for the hour this topic.&nbsp; She
had spent the winter in Rome, travelling directly from that city
to England, with just a little stop in Paris to buy a few
clothes.&nbsp; She had taken much satisfaction in Rome, where she
had made many friends; she assured him she knew half the Roman
nobility.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re charming people;
they&rsquo;ve only one fault, they stay too long,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; And in answer to his always slower process, &ldquo;I
mean when they come to see you,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They used to come every evening and then wanted to stay
till the next day.&nbsp; They were all princes and counts.&nbsp;
I used to give them cigars and cocktails&mdash;nobody else
did.&nbsp; I knew as many people as I wanted,&rdquo; she added in
a moment, feeling perhaps again in her visitor the intimate
intelligence with which six months before he had listened to her
account of her discomfiture in New York.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were
lots of English; I knew all the English and I mean to visit them
here.&nbsp; The Americans waited to see what the English would
do, so as to do the opposite.&nbsp; Thanks to that I was spared
some precious specimens.&nbsp; There are, you know, some fearful
ones.&nbsp; Besides, in Rome society doesn&rsquo;t matter if
you&rsquo;ve a feeling for the ruins and the Campagna; I found I
had an immense feeling for the Campagna.&nbsp; I was always
mooning round in some damp old temple.&nbsp; It reminded me a
good deal of the country round San Pablo&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for the <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>temples.&nbsp; I liked to think it all over when I was
riding round; I was always brooding over the past.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At this moment, nevertheless, Mrs. Headway had dismissed the
past; she was prepared to give herself up wholly to the
actual.&nbsp; She wished Waterville to advise her as to how she
should live&mdash;what she should do.&nbsp; Should she stay at an
hotel or should she take a house?&nbsp; She guessed she had
better take a house if she could find a nice one.&nbsp; Max
wanted to look for one, and she didn&rsquo;t know but what
she&rsquo;d let him; he got her such a nice one in Rome.&nbsp;
She said nothing about Sir Arthur Demesne, who, it seemed to
Waterville, would have been her natural guide and sponsor; he
wondered whether her relations with the Tory member had come to
an end.&nbsp; Waterville had met him a couple of times since the
opening of Parliament, and they had exchanged twenty words, none
of which, however, had had reference to Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; Our
young man, the previous autumn, had been recalled to London just
after the incident of which he found himself witness in the court
of the H&ocirc;tel Meurice; and all he knew of its consequence
was what he had learned from Littlemore, who, proceeding to
America, where he had suddenly been advised of reasons for his
spending the winter, passed through the British capital.&nbsp;
Littlemore had then reported that Mrs. Headway was enchanted with
Lady Demesne and had no words to speak of her kindness and
sweetness.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me she liked to know her
son&rsquo;s friends, and I told her I liked to know my
friends&rsquo; mothers,&rdquo; dear Nancy had reported.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should be willing to be old if I could be like
that,&rdquo; she had added, forgetting for the moment that the
crown of the maturer charm dangled before her at a diminishing
distance.&nbsp; The mother and son, at any rate, had retired to
Cannes together, and at this moment Littlemore had received
letters from home <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>which caused him to start for Arizona.&nbsp; Mrs.
Headway had accordingly been left to her own devices, and he was
afraid she had bored herself, though Mrs. Bagshaw had called upon
her.&nbsp; In November she had travelled to Italy, not by way of
Cannes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose she&rsquo;s up to in Rome?&rdquo;
Waterville had asked; his imagination failing him here, as he was
not yet in possession of that passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo; Littlemore had added in a moment.&nbsp; Before
leaving London he had further mentioned that Mrs. Headway, on his
going to take leave of her in Paris, had made another and rather
an unexpected attack.&nbsp; &ldquo;About the society
business&mdash;she said I must really do something: she
couldn&rsquo;t go on that way.&nbsp; And she appealed to me in
the name&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I quite know how to say
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be ever so glad if you&rsquo;d try,&rdquo;
Waterville had earnestly said, constantly reminding himself that
Americans in Europe were after all, in a degree, to a man in his
position, as the sheep to the shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the name of the affection we had formerly
entertained for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she was good enough to call it.&nbsp; But I deny it
all.&nbsp; If one had to have an affection for every woman one
used to sit up &lsquo;evenings&rsquo; with&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Littlemore had paused, not defining the result of such an
obligation.&nbsp; Waterville had tried to imagine what it would
be; while his friend had embarked for New York without telling
him how, in the event, he had resisted Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s
attack.</p>
<p>At Christmas Waterville knew of Sir Arthur&rsquo;s return to
England and believed he also knew that the Baronet hadn&rsquo;t
gone down to Rome.&nbsp; He had a theory that Lady Demesne was a
very clever woman&mdash;clever enough to make her son do what she
<a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>preferred and yet also make him think it his own
choice.&nbsp; She had been politic, accommodating, on the article
of the one civility rendered the American lady; but, having seen
and judged that heroine, had determined to stop short and to make
her son, if possible, stop.&nbsp; She had been sweet and kind, as
Mrs. Headway said, because for the moment this was easiest; but
she had paid her last visit on the same occasion as her
first.&nbsp; She had been sweet and kind, but she had set her
face as a stone, and if poor Nancy, camping on this new field,
expected to find any vague promises redeemed, she would taste of
the bitterness of shattered hopes.&nbsp; He had made up his mind
that, shepherd as he was, and Mrs. Headway one of his sheep, it
was none of his present duty to run about after her, especially
as she could be trusted not to stray too far.&nbsp; He saw her a
second time, and she still said nothing about Sir Arthur.&nbsp;
Waterville, who always had a theory, made sure she was watching
the clock, that this proved admirer was behind the hour.&nbsp;
She was also getting into a house; her courier had found her in
Chesterfield Street a little gem, which was to cost her only what
jewels cost.&nbsp; After all this our young man caught his breath
at Lady Demesne&rsquo;s note, and he went down to Longlands with
much the same impatience with which, in Paris, he would have
gone, had he been able, to the first night of a new comedy.&nbsp;
It seemed to him that through a sudden stroke of good fortune he
had received a <i>billet d&rsquo;auteur</i>.</p>
<p>It was agreeable to him to arrive at an English country-house
at the close of the day.&nbsp; He liked the drive from the
station in the twilight, the sight of the fields and copses and
cottages, vague and lonely in contrast to his definite lighted
goal; the sound of the wheels on the long avenue, which turned
and wound repeatedly without bringing him to what he reached <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>however at
last&mdash;the wide grey front with a glow in its scattered
windows and a sweep of still firmer gravel up to the door.&nbsp;
The front at Longlands, which was of this sober complexion, had a
grand pompous air; it was attributed to the genius of Sir
Christopher Wren.&nbsp; There were wings curving forward in a
semi-circle, with statues placed at intervals on the cornice; so
that in the flattering dusk it suggested a great Italian villa
dropped by some monstrous hand in an English park.&nbsp; He had
taken a late train, which left him but twenty minutes to dress
for dinner.&nbsp; He prided himself considerably on the art of
dressing both quickly and well; but this process left him no time
to wonder if the apartment to which he had been assigned befitted
his diplomatic dignity.&nbsp; On emerging from his room he found
there was an ambassador in the house, and this discovery was a
check to unrest.&nbsp; He tacitly assumed that he should have had
a better room if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the ambassador, who was
of course counted first.&nbsp; The large brilliant house gave an
impression of the last century and of foreign taste, of light
colours, high vaulted ceilings with pale mythological frescoes,
gilded doors surmounted by old French panels, faded tapestries
and delicate damasks, stores of ancient china among which great
jars of pink roses were conspicuous.&nbsp; The company had
assembled for dinner in the principal hall, which was animated by
a fire of great logs, and the muster was so large that Waterville
feared he was last.&nbsp; Lady Demesne gave him a smile and a
touch of her hand; she lacked effusiveness and, saying nothing in
particular, treated him as if he had been a common guest.&nbsp;
He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether he liked or hated that; but these
alternatives mattered equally little to his hostess, who looked
at her friends as if to verify a catalogue.&nbsp; The master of
the house was talking to a lady before the fire; when he caught
sight of <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Waterville across the room he waved &ldquo;How
d&rsquo;ye do&rdquo; with an air of being delighted to see
him.&nbsp; He had never had that air in Paris, and Waterville had
a chance to observe, what he had often heard, to how much greater
advantage the English appear in their country-houses.&nbsp; Lady
Demesne turned to him again with the sweet vague smile that could
somehow present a view without making a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for Mrs. Headway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she has arrived?&rdquo;&nbsp; Waterville had quite
forgotten this attraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came at half-past five.&nbsp; At six she went to
dress.&nbsp; She has had two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope the results will be proportionate,&rdquo;
the young man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the results&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Lady
Demesne murmured without looking at him; and in these simple
words he found the confirmation of his theory that she was
playing a deep game.&nbsp; He weighed the question of whom he
should sit next to at dinner, and hoped, with due deference to
Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s charms, that he might abut on a less
explored province.&nbsp; The results of a toilet she had
protracted through two hours were presently visible.&nbsp; She
appeared on the staircase which descended to the hall and which,
for three minutes, as she came down rather slowly, facing the
people beneath, placed her in considerable relief.&nbsp;
Waterville, as he watched her, felt the great importance of the
moment for her: it represented her entrance into English
society.&nbsp; Well, she entered English society in good shape,
as Nancy Beck would have said; with a brave free smile,
suggestive of no flutter, on her lips, and with the trophies of
the Rue de la Paix trailing behind her.&nbsp; She made a
portentous rumour as she moved.&nbsp; People turned their eyes to
her; there was soon a perceptible diminution of talk; though talk
hadn&rsquo;t been particularly audible.&nbsp; She <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>looked very
much alone, and it seemed rather studied of her to come down
last, though possibly, before her glass, she had but been unable
to please herself.&nbsp; For she evidently felt the importance of
the occasion, and Waterville was sure her heart beat fast.&nbsp;
She showed immense pluck, however; she smiled more intensely and
advanced like a woman acquainted with every social drawback of
beauty.&nbsp; She had at any rate the support of these
inconveniences; for nothing on this occasion was wanting to her
lustre, and the determination to succeed, which might have made
her hard, was veiled in the virtuous consciousness that she had
neglected nothing.&nbsp; Lady Demesne went forward to meet her;
Sir Arthur took no notice of her; and presently Waterville found
himself proceeding to dinner with the wife of an ecclesiastic, to
whom his hostess had presented him in the desolation of the
almost empty hall, when the other couples had flourished
away.&nbsp; The rank of this ecclesiastic in the hierarchy he
learned early on the morrow; but in the meantime it seemed to him
somehow strange that in England ecclesiastics should have
wives.&nbsp; English life even at the end of a year was full of
those surprises.&nbsp; The lady, however, was very easily
accounted for; she was in no sense a violent exception, and there
had been no need of the Reformation and the destruction of a
hundred abbeys to produce her.&nbsp; Her name was Mrs. April; she
was wrapped in a large lace shawl; to eat her dinner she removed
but one glove, and the other gave Waterville an odd impression
that the whole repast, in spite of its great completeness, was
something of the picnic order.</p>
<p>Mrs. Headway was opposite, at a little distance; she had been
taken in, as Waterville learned from his neighbour, by a General,
a gentleman with a lean aquiline face and a cultivated whisker,
and she had on the other side a smart young man of an identity <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>less
definite.&nbsp; Poor Sir Arthur sat between two ladies much older
than himself, whose names, redolent of history, Waterville had
often heard and had associated with figures more romantic.&nbsp;
Mrs. Headway gave her countryman no greeting; she evidently
hadn&rsquo;t seen him till they were seated at table, when she
stared at him with a violence of surprise that was like the
interruption of a lively tune.&nbsp; It was a copious and
well-ordered banquet, but as he looked up and down the table he
sought to appraise the contributed lustre, the collective
<i>scintillae</i>, that didn&rsquo;t proceed from silver,
porcelain, glass or shining damask.&nbsp; Presently renouncing
the effort, however, he became conscious he was judging the
affair much more from Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s point of view than
from his own.&nbsp; He knew no one but Mrs. April, who,
displaying an almost motherly desire to give him information,
told him the names of many of their companions; in return for
which he explained to her that he was not in that set.&nbsp; Mrs.
Headway got on in perfection with her warrior; Waterville noticed
her more than he showed; he saw how that officer, evidently a
cool hand, was drawing her out.&nbsp; Waterville hoped she would
be careful.&nbsp; He was capable, in his way, of frolic thought,
and as he compared her with the rest of the company said to
himself that she was a very plucky little woman and that her
present undertaking had a touch of the heroic.&nbsp; She was
alone against many, and her opponents were a serried phalanx;
those who were there represented a thousand others.&nbsp; Her
type so violated every presumption blooming there that to the eye
of the imagination she stood very much on her merits.&nbsp; Such
people seemed so completely made up, so unconscious of effort, so
surrounded with things to rest upon; the men with their clean
complexions, their well-hung chins, their cold pleasant eyes,
their shoulders set back, their absence of gesture; the <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>women,
several very handsome, half-strangled in strings of pearls, with
smooth plain tresses, seeming to look at nothing in particular,
supporting silence as if it were as becoming as candle-light, yet
talking a little sometimes in fresh rich voices.&nbsp; They were
all wrapped in a community of ideas, of traditions; they
understood each other&rsquo;s accent, even each other&rsquo;s
deviations.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway, with all her prettiness, exceeded
these licences.&nbsp; She was foreign, exaggerated, she had too
much expression; she might have been engaged for the
evening.&nbsp; Waterville remarked, moreover, that English
society was always clutching at amusement and that the business
was transacted on a cash basis.&nbsp; If Mrs. Headway should
sufficiently amuse she would succeed, and her fortune&mdash;if
fortune there was&mdash;would be no hindrance.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room, after dinner, he went up to her, but she
gave him no greeting.&nbsp; She only faced him with an expression
he had never seen before&mdash;a strange bold expression of
displeasure.&nbsp; It made her fearfully common.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
have you come down here?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you
come to watch me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville coloured to the roots of his hair.&nbsp; He knew it
was terribly little like a diplomatist, but he was unable to
control his heat.&nbsp; He was justly shocked, he was angry and
in addition he was mystified.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came because I was
asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who asked you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same person who asked you, I suppose&mdash;Lady
Demesne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an old cat!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Nancy Beck
turned away from him.</p>
<p>He turned from her as well.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know what he
had done to deserve such treatment.&nbsp; It was a complete
surprise; he had never seen her like that before.&nbsp; She was a
very vulgar woman; that was the way people dealt with each other,
he supposed, on <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>hideous back piazzas.&nbsp; He threw himself almost
passionately into contact with the others, who all seemed to him,
possibly a little by contrast, extraordinarily genial and
friendly.&nbsp; He had not, however, the consolation of seeing
Mrs. Headway punished for her rudeness&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t in
the least neglected.&nbsp; On the contrary, in the part of the
room where she sat the group was denser and repeatedly broke into
gusts of unanimous laughter.&nbsp; Yes, if she should amuse them
she might doubtless get anywhere and do anything, and evidently
she was amusing them.</p>
<h3><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>VII</h3>
<p>If she was strange, at any rate he hadn&rsquo;t come to the
end of her strangeness.&nbsp; The next day was a Sunday and
uncommonly fine; he was down before breakfast and took a walk in
the park, stopping to gaze at the thin-legged deer on the remoter
slopes, who reminded him of small pin-cushions turned upside
down, and wandering along the edge of a large sheet of ornamental
water which had a temple in imitation of that of Vesta on an
island in the middle.&nbsp; He thought at this time no more of
Mrs. Headway; he only reflected that these stately objects had
for at least a hundred years furnished a background to a great
deal of heavy history.&nbsp; Further reflexion would perhaps have
suggested to him that she might yet become a feature in the
record that so spread itself.&nbsp; Two or three ladies failed to
appear at breakfast; the well-known Texan belle was one of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tells me she never leaves her room till
noon,&rdquo; he heard Lady Demesne say to the General, her
companion of the previous evening, who had asked about her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She takes three hours to dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a monstrous clever woman!&rdquo; the
General declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do it in three hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean the way she keeps her wits about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think she&rsquo;s very clever,&rdquo; said Lady
Demesne on a system in which our young man <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>flattered
himself he saw more meaning than the General could.&nbsp; There
was something in this tall straight deliberate woman, who seemed
at once to yearn and to retire, that Waterville admired.&nbsp;
With her delicate surface, her conventional mildness, he made out
she was strong; she had set her patience upon a height and
carried it like a diadem.&nbsp; She had the young American little
visibly on her mind, but every now and then she indulged in some
vague demonstration that showed she had not forgotten him.&nbsp;
Sir Arthur himself was apparently in excellent spirits, though he
too never bustled nor overflowed; he only went about looking very
fresh and fair, as if he took a bath every hour or two, and very
secure against the unexpected.&nbsp; Waterville had exchanged
even fewer remarks with him than with his mother; but the master
of the house had found occasion to say the night before, in the
smoking-room, that he was delighted this friend had been able to
come, and that if he was fond of real English scenery there were
several things about that he should like very much to show
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must give me an hour or two before you go, you
know; I really think there are some things you&rsquo;ll care
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Arthur spoke as if Waterville would be very fastidious; he
seemed to wish to do the right thing by him.&nbsp; On the Sunday
morning after breakfast he inquired if he should care to go to
church; most of the ladies and several of the men were
going.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as you please, you know; but
there&rsquo;s rather a pretty walk across the fields and a
curious little church&mdash;they say of King Stephen&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville knew what this meant; it was already a
treasure.&nbsp; Besides, he liked going to church, above all when
he sat in the Squire&rsquo;s pew, which was sometimes as big as a
boudoir and all fadedly upholstered <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to match.&nbsp; So he replied that
he should be delighted.&nbsp; Then he added without explaining
his reason: &ldquo;Is Mrs. Headway going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said his host with an
abrupt change of tone&mdash;as if he inquired into the movements
of the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English are awfully queer!&rdquo; Waterville
consoled himself with secretly exclaiming; to which wisdom, since
his arrival among them, he had had recourse whenever he
encountered a gap in the consistency of things.&nbsp; The church
was even a rarer treasure than Sir Arthur&rsquo;s description of
it, and Waterville felt Mrs. Headway had been a fool not to
come.&nbsp; He knew what she was after&mdash;she wished to study
English life so that she might take possession of it; and to pass
in among a hedge of bobbing rustics and sit among the monuments
of the old Demesnes would have told her a great deal about
English life.&nbsp; If she wished to fortify herself for the
struggle she had better come to that old church.&nbsp; When he
returned to Longlands&mdash;he had walked back across the meadows
with the archdeacon&rsquo;s lady, who was a vigorous
pedestrian&mdash;it wanted half an hour of luncheon and he was
unwilling to go indoors.&nbsp; He remembered he had not yet seen
the gardens, and wandered away in search of them.&nbsp; They were
on a scale that enabled him to find them without difficulty, and
they looked as if they had been kept up unremittingly for a
century or two.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t advanced very far between
their blooming borders when he heard a voice that he recognised,
and a moment after, at the turn of an alley, came upon Mrs.
Headway, who was attended by the master of the scene.&nbsp; She
was bareheaded beneath her parasol, which she flung back,
stopping short as she beheld her compatriot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s Mr. Waterville come to spy me out as <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>usual!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was with this remark she greeted
the slightly-embarrassed young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, you&rsquo;ve come home from church?&rdquo; Sir
Arthur said, pulling out his watch.</p>
<p>Waterville was struck with his coolness.&nbsp; He admired it;
for, after all, he noted, it must have been disagreeable to him
to be interrupted.&nbsp; He felt rather an ass, and wished he had
kept hold of Mrs. April, to give him the air of having come for
her sake.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway was looking adorably fresh in attire
that Waterville, who had his ideas on such matters, felt sure
wouldn&rsquo;t be regarded as the proper thing for a Sunday
morning in an English country-house: a n&eacute;glig&eacute; of
white flounces and frills interspersed with yellow
ribbons&mdash;a garment Madame de Pompadour might have sported to
receive Louis XV., but probably wouldn&rsquo;t have worn for a
public airing.&nbsp; The sight of this costume gave the finishing
touch to his impression that she knew on the whole what she was
about.&nbsp; She would take a line of her own; she wouldn&rsquo;t
be too accommodating.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t come down to
breakfast; she wouldn&rsquo;t go to church; she would wear on
Sunday mornings little elaborately informal dresses and look
dreadfully un-British and un-Protestant.&nbsp; Perhaps after all
this was best.&nbsp; She began to talk with a certain
volubility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this too lovely?&nbsp; I walked all the way
from the house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not much at walking, but the
grass in this place is like a parlour.&nbsp; The whole
thing&rsquo;s driving me wild.&nbsp; Sir Arthur, you ought to go
and look after the Ambassador; it&rsquo;s shameful the way
I&rsquo;ve kept you.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t trouble about the
Ambassador?&nbsp; You said just now you had scarcely spoken to
him, and you must make that right up.&nbsp; I never saw such a
way of neglecting your guests.&nbsp; Is it the usual style over
here?&nbsp; Go and take him out to ride or make him play a game
of billiards.&nbsp; Mr. Waterville will <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>take me
home; besides, I want to scold him for spying on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man sharply resented her charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
no idea whatever you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t hiding,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll see Mrs. Headway back
to the house.&nbsp; I think I ought to look after old
Davidoff.&nbsp; I believe luncheon&rsquo;s at two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left them, and Waterville wandered through the gardens with
Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; She at once sought again to learn if he had
come there to &ldquo;dog&rdquo; her; but this inquiry
wasn&rsquo;t accompanied, to his surprise, with the acrimony she
had displayed the night before.&nbsp; He was determined not to
let that pass, however; when people had treated him in that way
they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;m always thinking of you?&rdquo;
he derisively demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of my mind
<i>sometimes</i>.&nbsp; I came this way to look at the gardens,
and if you hadn&rsquo;t spoken to me should have passed
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Headway was perfectly good-natured; she appeared not even
to hear his defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has got two other
places,&rdquo; she simply rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what I wanted to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t nevertheless be turned from his
grievance.&nbsp; That mode of reparation to a person whom you had
insulted which consisted in forgetting you had done so was
doubtless largely in use on back piazzas; but a creature of any
spirit required a different form.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you mean
last night by accusing me of having come down here to watch
you?&nbsp; Pardon me if I tell you I think you grossly
rude.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sting of the imputation lay in the fact
that there was a certain amount of truth in it; yet for a moment
Mrs. Headway, looking very blank, failed to recover it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a barbarian, after all,&rdquo; thought <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Waterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thinks a woman may slap a
man&rsquo;s face and run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried suddenly, &ldquo;I
remember&mdash;I was angry with you!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t expect
to see you.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t really mind about it at
all.&nbsp; Every now and then I get mad like that and work it off
on any one that&rsquo;s handy.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s over in three
minutes and I never think of it again.&nbsp; I confess I was mad
last night; I could have shot the old woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Arthur&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; She has no business
here anyway.&nbsp; In this country when the husband dies
they&rsquo;re expected to clear out.&nbsp; She has a house of her
own ten miles from here and another in Portman Square; so she
ain&rsquo;t in want of good locations.&nbsp; But she
sticks&mdash;she sticks to him like a strong plaster.&nbsp; It
came over me as I kind of analysed that she didn&rsquo;t invite
me here because she liked me, but because she suspects me.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s afraid we&rsquo;ll make a match and she thinks I
ain&rsquo;t good enough for her son.&nbsp; She must think
I&rsquo;m in a great hurry to make him mine.&nbsp; I never went
after him, he came after me.&nbsp; I should never have thought of
anything if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him.&nbsp; He began it last
summer at Homburg; he wanted to know why I didn&rsquo;t come to
England; he told me I should have great success.&nbsp; He
doesn&rsquo;t know much about it anyway; he hasn&rsquo;t got much
gumption.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a very nice man all the same;
it&rsquo;s very pleasant to see him surrounded by
his&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Headway paused a moment, her
appreciation ranging: &ldquo;Surrounded by all his old
heirlooms.&nbsp; I like the old place,&rdquo; she went on;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s beautifully mounted; I&rsquo;m quite satisfied
with what I&rsquo;ve seen.&nbsp; I thought Lady Demesne
well-impressed; she left a card on me in London and very soon
after wrote to me to ask me here.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m very quick;
I sometimes see things in a flash.&nbsp; I saw something <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>yesterday
when she came to speak to me at dinner-time.&nbsp; She saw I
looked pretty and refined, and it made her blue with rage; she
hoped I&rsquo;d be some sort of a horror.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like
very much to oblige her, but what can one do?&nbsp; Then I saw
she had asked me only because he insisted.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
come to see me when I first arrived&mdash;he never came near me
for ten days.&nbsp; She managed to prevent him; she got him to
make some promise.&nbsp; But he changed his mind after a little,
and then he had to do something really polite.&nbsp; He called
three days in succession, and he made her come.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
one of those women who holds out as long as she can and then
seems to give in while she&rsquo;s really fussing more than
ever.&nbsp; She hates me as if I knew something about
her&mdash;when I don&rsquo;t even know what she thinks I&rsquo;ve
done myself.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very underhand; she&rsquo;s a
regular old cat.&nbsp; When I saw you last night at dinner I
thought she had got you here to help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help her?&rdquo; Waterville echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell her about me.&nbsp; To give her information she
can make use of against me.&nbsp; You may give her all you
like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville was almost breathless with the attention he had
paid this extraordinary burst of confidence, and now he really
felt faint.&nbsp; He stopped short; Mrs. Headway went on a few
steps and then, stopping too, turned and shone at him in the glow
of her egotism.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most unspeakable
woman!&rdquo; he wailed.&nbsp; She seemed to him indeed a
barbarian.</p>
<p>She laughed at him&mdash;he felt she was laughing at his
expression of face&mdash;and her laugh rang through the stately
gardens.&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of a woman&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no delicacy&rdquo;&mdash;he&rsquo;d
keep it up.</p>
<p>She coloured quickly, though, strange to say, without further
irritation.&nbsp; &ldquo;No delicacy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to keep those things to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Oh I know what you mean; I talk about
everything.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m excited I&rsquo;ve got to
talk.&nbsp; But I must do things in my own way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got plenty of delicacy when people are nice to me.&nbsp; Ask
Arthur Demesne if I ain&rsquo;t delicate&mdash;ask George
Littlemore if I ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand there all
day; come on to lunch!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Headway resumed her
walk while her companion, having balanced, slowly overtook
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait till I get settled; then I&rsquo;ll be
delicate,&rdquo; she pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be
delicate when you&rsquo;re trying to save your life.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very well for <i>you</i> to talk, with the whole State
Department to back you.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;m excited.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got right hold of this thing, and I don&rsquo;t mean
to let go!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before they reached the house she let him
know why he had been invited to Longlands at the same time as
herself.&nbsp; Waterville would have liked to believe his
personal attractions sufficiently explained the fact, but she
took no account of this supposition.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway preferred
to see herself in an element of ingenious machination, where
everything that happened referred to her and was aimed at
her.&nbsp; Waterville had been asked then because he represented,
however modestly, the American Legation, and their host had a
friendly desire to make it appear that his pretty American
visitor, of whom no one knew anything, was under the protection
of that establishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would start me
better,&rdquo; the lady in question complacently set forth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help yourself&mdash;you&rsquo;ve helped to
start me.&nbsp; If he had known the Minister he&rsquo;d have
asked him&mdash;or the first secretary.&nbsp; But he don&rsquo;t
know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the house by the time she had developed her idea,
which gave Waterville a pretext more than sufficient for
detaining her in the portico.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to say Sir
Arthur has told you this?&rdquo; he inquired almost sternly.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Told me?&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; Do you
suppose I&rsquo;d let him take the tone with me that I need any
favours?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to hear him tell me I&rsquo;m in
want of assistance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;at the
pace you go yourself.&nbsp; You say it to every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every one?&nbsp; I say it to you and to George
Littlemore&mdash;when I get nervous.&nbsp; I say it to you
because I like you, and to him because I&rsquo;m afraid of
him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not in the least afraid of you, by the
way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all alone&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got any
one.&nbsp; I must have some comfort, mustn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Sir
Arthur scolded me for putting you off last night&mdash;he noticed
it; and that was what made me guess his idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to him,&rdquo; said Waterville
rather bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mind you answer for me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you want
me to take your arm to go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a most extraordinary combination!&rdquo;
he gave to all the winds as she stood smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come, don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> fall in love with
me!&rdquo; she cried with a laugh; and, without taking his arm,
she passed in before him.</p>
<p>That evening, before he went to dress for dinner, he wandered
into the library, where he felt certain he should find some
superior bindings.&nbsp; There was no one in the room and he
spent a happy half-hour among treasures of old reading and
triumphs of old morocco.&nbsp; He had a great esteem for good
literature, he held that it should have handsome covers.&nbsp;
The daylight had begun to wane, but whenever, in the rich-looking
dimness, he made out the glimmer of a well-gilded back, he took
down the volume and carried it to one of the deep-set
windows.&nbsp; He had just finished the inspection of a
delightfully fragrant folio, and was about to carry it back to
its niche, when he found himself face to face with Lady <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>Demesne.&nbsp; He was sharply startled, for her tall
slim figure, her preserved fairness, which looked white in the
high brown room, and the air of serious intention with which she
presented herself, all gave something spectral to her
presence.&nbsp; He saw her countenance dimly light, however, and
heard her say with the vague despair of her neutrality:
&ldquo;Are you looking at our books?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid
they&rsquo;re rather dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull?&nbsp; Why they&rsquo;re as bright as the day they
were bound.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned on her the glittering
panels of his folio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t looked at them for a
long time,&rdquo; she murmured, going nearer to the window, where
she stood looking out.&nbsp; Beyond the clear pane the park
stretched away, the menace of night already mantling the great
limbs of the oaks.&nbsp; The place appeared cold and empty, and
the trees had an air of conscious importance, as if Nature
herself had been bribed somehow to take the side of county
families.&nbsp; Her ladyship was no easy person for talk;
spontaneity had never come to her, and to express herself might
have been for her modesty like some act of undressing in
public.&nbsp; Her very simplicity was conventional, though it was
rather a noble convention.&nbsp; You might have pitied her for
the sense of her living tied so tight, with consequent moral
cramps, to certain rigid ideals.&nbsp; This made her at times
seem tired, like a person who had undertaken too much.&nbsp; She
said nothing for a moment, and there was an appearance of design
in her silence, as if she wished to let him know she had appealed
to him without the trouble of announcing it.&nbsp; She had been
accustomed to expect people would suppose things, to save her
questions and explanations.&nbsp; Waterville made some haphazard
remark about the beauty of the evening&mdash;in point of fact the
weather had changed for the worse&mdash;to which she <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>vouchsafed
no reply.&nbsp; But she presently said with her usual gentleness:
&ldquo;I hoped I should find you here&mdash;I should like to ask
you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can tell you&mdash;I shall be
delighted!&rdquo; the young man declared.</p>
<p>She gave him a pleading look that seemed to say: &ldquo;Please
be very simple&mdash;very simple indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she
glanced about her as if there had been other people in the room;
she didn&rsquo;t wish to appear closeted with him or to have come
on purpose.&nbsp; There she was at any rate, and she
proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;When my son told me he should ask you to
come down I was very glad.&nbsp; I mean of course we were
delighted&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And she paused a moment.&nbsp; But
she next went on: &ldquo;I want to ask you about Mrs.
Headway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here it is!&rdquo; cried Waterville within
himself.&nbsp; But he could show no wincing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah yes,
I see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind my asking you?&nbsp; I hope you don&rsquo;t
mind.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t any one else to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son knows her much better than I do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said this without intention of malice, simply to escape from
the difficulties of the situation, but after he had spoken was
almost frightened by his mocking sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he knows her.&nbsp; She knows
<i>him</i>&mdash;which is very different.&nbsp; When I ask him
about her he merely tells me she&rsquo;s fascinating.&nbsp; She
<i>is</i> fascinating,&rdquo; said her ladyship with inimitable
dryness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think, myself.&nbsp; I like her very much,&rdquo;
Waterville returned cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in all the better position to speak of her
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To speak well of her,&rdquo; the young man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;if you can.&nbsp; I should be delighted
to hear you do that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I wish&mdash;to hear
some good of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have seemed after this that nothing could <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>have
remained but for our friend to break out in categoric praise of
his fellow guest; but he was no more to be tempted into that
danger than into another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can only say I like
her,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has been very kind to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one seems to like her,&rdquo; said Lady Demesne
with an unstudied effect of pathos.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
certainly very amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very good-natured.&nbsp; I think she has no
end of good intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by good intentions?&rdquo; asked Lady
Demesne very sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it strikes me she wants to be friendly and
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed she does!&nbsp; But of course you have to defend
her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s your countrywoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To defend her I must wait till she&rsquo;s
attacked,&rdquo; Waterville laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true.&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t call your
attention to the fact that I&rsquo;m not attacking her,&rdquo;
his hostess observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never attack a person
staying in this house.&nbsp; I only want to know something about
her, and if you can&rsquo;t tell me perhaps at least you can
mention some one who will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tell you herself.&nbsp; Tell you by the
hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What she has told my son?&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
understand it.&nbsp; My son doesn&rsquo;t understand
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had a full pause, a profusion of patience;
then she resumed disappointedly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
strange.&nbsp; I rather hoped you might explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned the case over.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
can&rsquo;t explain Mrs. Headway,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you admit she&rsquo;s very peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even to this, however, he hesitated to commit himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too great a responsibility to answer
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He allowed he was very disobliging; he knew
exactly what Lady Demesne wished him to say.&nbsp; <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>He was
unprepared to blight the reputation of Mrs. Headway to
accommodate her; and yet, with his cultivated imagination, he
could enter perfectly into the feelings of this tender formal
serious woman who&mdash;it was easy to see&mdash;had looked for
her own happiness in the observance of duty and in extreme
constancy to two or three objects of devotion chosen once for
all.&nbsp; She must indeed have had a conception of life in the
light of which Nancy Beck would show both for displeasing and for
dangerous.&nbsp; But he presently became aware she had taken his
last words as a concession in which she might find help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why I ask you these things then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve an idea,&rdquo; said Waterville,
persisting in irrelevant laughter.&nbsp; His laugh sounded
foolish in his own ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know that, I think you ought to assist
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her tone changed now; there was a quick tremor
in it; he could feel the confession of distress.&nbsp; The
distress verily was deep; it had pressed her hard before she made
up her mind to speak to him.&nbsp; He was sorry for her and
determined to be very serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could help you I would.&nbsp; But my
position&rsquo;s very difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so difficult as mine!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was going all lengths; she was really appealing to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine you under obligations to Mrs.
Headway.&nbsp; You seem to me so different,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>He was not insensible to any discrimination that told in his
favour; but these words shocked him as if they had been an
attempt at bribery.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you
don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; he ventured to bring out.</p>
<p>She turned her eyes through the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re really surprised, though possibly
you try to be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like her at any rate, and I
can&rsquo;t fancy why my son should.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very
pretty and appears very clever; but I don&rsquo;t trust
her.&nbsp; I <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>don&rsquo;t know what has taken possession of him;
it&rsquo;s not usual in his family to marry people like
that.&nbsp; Surely she&rsquo;s of <i>no</i> breeding.&nbsp; The
person I should propose would be so very different&mdash;perhaps
you can see what I mean.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something in her
history we don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; My son understands it no
better than I.&nbsp; If you could throw any light on it, that
might be a help.&nbsp; If I treat you with such confidence the
first time I see you it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know where
to turn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m exceedingly anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain enough she was anxious; her manner had become
more vehement; her eyes seemed to shine in the thickening
dusk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you very sure there&rsquo;s danger?&rdquo;
Waterville asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has he proposed to her and has she
jumped at him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wait till they settle it all it will be too
late.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve reason to believe that my son&rsquo;s not
engaged, but I fear he&rsquo;s terribly entangled.&nbsp; At the
same time he&rsquo;s very uneasy, and that may save him
yet.&nbsp; He has a great sense of honour.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not
satisfied about her past life; he doesn&rsquo;t know what to
think of what we&rsquo;ve been told.&nbsp; Even what she admits
is so strange.&nbsp; She has been married four or five
times.&nbsp; She has been divorced again and again.&nbsp; It
seems so extraordinary.&nbsp; She tells him that in America
it&rsquo;s different, and I dare say you haven&rsquo;t our ideas;
but really there&rsquo;s a limit to everything.&nbsp; There must
have been great irregularities&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid great
scandals.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dreadful to have to accept such
things.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t told me all this, but it&rsquo;s
not necessary he should tell me.&nbsp; I know him well enough to
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know you&rsquo;re speaking to me?&rdquo;
Waterville asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&nbsp; But I must tell you I shall
repeat to him anything you may say against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better say nothing then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
delicate.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s quite undefended.&nbsp; One
may like <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>her or not, of course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen nothing of
her that isn&rsquo;t perfectly correct,&rdquo; our young man
wound up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve heard nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembered Littlemore&rsquo;s view that there were cases in
which a man was bound in honour to tell an untruth, and he
wondered if this were such a one.&nbsp; Lady Demesne imposed
herself, she made him believe in the reality of her grievance,
and he saw the gulf that divided her from a pushing little woman
who had lived with Western editors.&nbsp; She was right to wish
not to be connected with Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; After all, there had
been nothing in his relations with that lady to hold him down to
lying for her.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t sought her acquaintance, she
had sought his; she had sent for him to come and see her.&nbsp;
And yet he couldn&rsquo;t give her away&mdash;that stuck in his
throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I really can&rsquo;t say
anything.&nbsp; And it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Your son
won&rsquo;t give her up because I happen not to like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were to believe she had done wrong he&rsquo;d
give her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve no right to say so,&rdquo; said
Waterville.</p>
<p>Lady Demesne turned away; he indeed disappointed her and he
feared she was going to break out: &ldquo;Why then do you suppose
I asked you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; She quitted her place near the
window and prepared apparently to leave the room.&nbsp; But she
stopped short.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know something against her, but
you won&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hugged his folio and looked awkward.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
attribute things to me.&nbsp; I shall never say
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re perfectly free.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s some one else who knows, I think&mdash;another
American&mdash;a gentleman who was in Paris when my son was
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve forgotten his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s?&nbsp; I suppose you
mean George Littlemore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mr. Littlemore.&nbsp; He has a sister
whom I&rsquo;ve met; I didn&rsquo;t know she was his sister till
to-day.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway spoke of her, but I find she
doesn&rsquo;t know her.&nbsp; That itself is a proof, I
think.&nbsp; Do you think <i>he</i> would help me?&rdquo; Lady
Demesne asked very simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, but you can try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had come with you.&nbsp; Do you think
he&rsquo;d come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in America at this moment, but I believe he
soon comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took this in with interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall go to his
sister; I shall ask her to bring him to see me.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
extremely nice; I think she&rsquo;ll understand.&nbsp;
Unfortunately there&rsquo;s very little time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waterville bethought himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count
too much on George Littlemore,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men have no pity,&rdquo; she grimly sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we pity you?&nbsp; How can Mrs. Headway hurt
such a person as you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Lady Demesne cast about.&nbsp; &ldquo;It hurts me to hear her
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her voice is very liquid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He liked his
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much, it seemed to Waterville; Nancy Beck was
open to criticism, and he himself had declared she was a
barbarian.&nbsp; Yet she wasn&rsquo;t horrible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your son to pity you.&nbsp; If he
doesn&rsquo;t how can you expect it of others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh but he does!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a majesty that
was more striking even than her logic his hostess moved to the
door.</p>
<p>Waterville advanced to open it for her, and as she passed out
he said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you can do&mdash;try to
like her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shot him a woeful glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would
be&mdash;worst of all!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>VIII</h3>
<p>George Littlemore arrived in London on the twentieth of May,
and one of the first things he did was to go and see Waterville
at the Legation, where he mentioned that he had taken for the
rest of the season a house at Queen Anne&rsquo;s Gate, so that
his sister and her husband, who, under the pressure of diminished
rents, had let their own town residence, might come up and spend
a couple of months with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the consequences of your having a house will be
that you&rsquo;ll have to entertain the Texan belle,&rdquo; our
young man said.</p>
<p>Littlemore sat there with his hands crossed on his stick; he
looked at his friend with an eye that failed to kindle at the
mention of this lady&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has she got into
European society?&rdquo; he rather languidly inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much, I should say.&nbsp; She has a house and a
carriage and diamonds and everything handsome.&nbsp; She seems
already to know a lot of people; they put her name in the
<i>Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; She has come up very quickly;
she&rsquo;s almost famous.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s asking about
her&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be plied with questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore listened gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did she get
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She met a large party at Longlands and made them all
think her great fun.&nbsp; They must have taken her up; she only
wanted a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Her
old friend rallied after a moment to the interest of this news,
marking his full appreciation of it by a burst of laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To think of Nancy Beck!&nbsp; The people here do beat the
Dutch!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one they won&rsquo;t go
after.&nbsp; They wouldn&rsquo;t touch her in New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh New York&rsquo;s quite old-fashioned and
rococo,&rdquo; said Waterville; and he announced to Littlemore
that Lady Demesne was very eager for his arrival and wanted his
aid to prevent her son&rsquo;s bringing such a person into the
family.&nbsp; Littlemore was apparently not alarmed at her
ladyship&rsquo;s projects, and intimated, in the manner of a man
who thought them rather impertinent, that he could trust himself
to keep out of her way.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a proper
marriage at any rate,&rdquo; the second secretary urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not if he loves her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh if that&rsquo;s all you want!&rdquo;&mdash;which
seemed a degree of cynicism startling to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you marry her yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly if I were in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took care not to be that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did&mdash;and so Demesne had better have
done.&nbsp; However, since he&rsquo;s bitten&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Littlemore let the rest of his sentence too indifferently
drop.</p>
<p>Waterville presently asked him how he would manage, in view of
his sister&rsquo;s advent, about asking Mrs. Headway to his
house; and he replied that he would manage by simply not asking
her.&nbsp; On this Waterville pronounced him highly inconsistent;
to which Littlemore rejoined that it was very possible.&nbsp; But
he asked whether they couldn&rsquo;t talk about something else
than Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t enter into the young
man&rsquo;s interest in her&mdash;they were sure to have enough
of her later without such impatience.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>Waterville would have been sorry to give a false idea
of his interest in the wonderful woman; he knew too well the
feeling had definite limits.&nbsp; He had been two or three times
to see her, but it was a relief to be able to believe her quite
independent of him.&nbsp; There had been no revival of those free
retorts which had marked their stay at Longlands.&nbsp; She could
dispense with assistance now; she knew herself in the current of
success.&nbsp; She pretended to be surprised at her good fortune,
especially at its rapidity; but she was really surprised at
nothing.&nbsp; She took things as they came and, being
essentially a woman of action, wasted almost as little time in
elation as she would have done in despondence.&nbsp; She talked a
great deal about Lord Edward and Lady Margaret and such others of
that &ldquo;standing&rdquo; as had shown a desire for her
acquaintance; professing to measure perfectly the sources of a
growing popularity.&nbsp; &ldquo;They come to laugh at me,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;they come simply to get things to repeat.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t open my mouth but they burst into fits.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a settled thing that I&rsquo;m a grand case of the
American funny woman; if I make the least remark they begin to
roar.&nbsp; I must express myself somehow; and indeed when I hold
my tongue they think me funnier than ever.&nbsp; They repeat what
I say to a great person, and a great person told some of them the
other night that he wanted to hear me for himself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll do for him what I do for the others; no better and no
worse.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how I do it; I talk the only way
I can.&nbsp; They tell me it isn&rsquo;t so much the things I say
as the way I say them.&nbsp; Well, they&rsquo;re very easy to
please.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t really care for me, you
know&mdash;they don&rsquo;t love me for myself and the way I want
to be loved; it&rsquo;s only to be able to repeat Mrs.
Headway&rsquo;s &lsquo;last.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every one wants to have
it first; it&rsquo;s a regular race.&rdquo;&nbsp; When she found
what was expected of her she undertook to supply the article in
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>abundance&mdash;the poor little woman worked hard at
the vernacular.&nbsp; If the taste of London lay that way she
would do her best to gratify it; it was only a pity she
hadn&rsquo;t known before: she would have made more extensive
preparations.&nbsp; She had thought it a disadvantage of old to
live in Arizona, in Dakotah, in the newly-admitted States; but
now she saw that, as she phrased it to herself, this was the best
thing that ever had happened to her.&nbsp; She tried to recover
the weird things she had heard out there, and keenly regretted
she hadn&rsquo;t taken them down in writing; she drummed up the
echoes of the Rocky Mountains and practised the intonations of
the Pacific slope.&nbsp; When she saw her audience in convulsions
she argued that this was success: she inferred that had she only
come five years sooner she might have married a Duke.&nbsp; That
would have been even a greater attraction for the London world
than the actual proceedings of Sir Arthur Demesne, who, however,
lived sufficiently in the eye of society to justify the rumour
that there were bets about town as to the issue of his already
protracted courtship.&nbsp; It was food for curiosity to see a
young man of his pattern&mdash;one of the few
&ldquo;earnest&rdquo; young men of the Tory side, with an income
sufficient for tastes more vivid than those by which he was
known&mdash;make up to a lady several years older than himself,
whose fund of Texan slang was even larger than her stock of
dollars.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway had got a good many new ideas since
her arrival in London, but she had also not lost her grasp of
several old ones.&nbsp; The chief of these&mdash;it was now a
year old&mdash;was that Sir Arthur was the very most eligible
and, shrewdly considered, taking one thing with another, most
valuable young man in the world.&nbsp; There were of course a
good many things he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t amusing;
he wasn&rsquo;t insinuating; he wasn&rsquo;t of an absolutely
irrepressible ardour.&nbsp; She believed <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>he was
constant, but he was certainly not eager.&nbsp; With these
things, however, she could perfectly dispense; she had in
particular quite outlived the need of being amused.&nbsp; She had
had a very exciting life, and her vision of happiness at present
was to be magnificently bored.&nbsp; The idea of complete and
uncriticised respectability filled her soul with satisfaction;
her imagination prostrated itself in the presence of this
virtue.&nbsp; She was aware she had achieved it but ill in her
own person; but she could now at least connect herself with it by
sacred ties.&nbsp; She could prove in that way what was her
deepest feeling.&nbsp; This was a religious appreciation of Sir
Arthur&rsquo;s great quality&mdash;his smooth and rounded, his
blooming lily-like exemption from social flaws.</p>
<p>She was at home when Littlemore went to see her and surrounded
by several visitors to whom she was giving a late cup of tea and
to whom she introduced her tall compatriot.&nbsp; He stayed till
they dispersed, in spite of the man&oelig;uvres of a gentleman
who evidently desired to outlinger him, but who, whatever might
have been his happy fortune on former visits, received on this
occasion no encouragement from their hostess.&nbsp; He looked at
Littlemore slowly, beginning with his boots and travelling up as
if to discover the reason of so unexpected a preference, and
then, with no salutation to him, left the pair face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to see what you&rsquo;ll do for me
now you&rsquo;ve got your sister with you,&rdquo; Mrs. Headway
presently remarked, having heard of this circumstance from Rupert
Waterville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I realise you&rsquo;ll have to do
something, you know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for you, but I
don&rsquo;t see how you can get off.&nbsp; You might ask me to
dine some day when she&rsquo;s dining out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d come
even then, I think, because I want to keep on the right side of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that the wrong side,&rdquo; said Littlemore.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Yes, I see.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your sister
that&rsquo;s on the right side.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re in rather a
bad fix, ain&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to be
&lsquo;good&rsquo; and mean, or you&rsquo;ve got to be kind with
a little courage.&nbsp; However, you take those things very
quietly.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something in you that exasperates
me.&nbsp; What does your sister think of me?&nbsp; Does she hate
me?&rdquo; Nancy persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows nothing about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told her nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she asked you?&nbsp; That shows how she
hates me.&nbsp; She thinks I ain&rsquo;t creditable to
America.&nbsp; I know <i>that</i> way of doing it.&nbsp; She
wants to show people over here that, however they may be taken in
by me, she knows much better.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;ll have to ask
you about me; she can&rsquo;t go on for ever.&nbsp; Then
what&rsquo;ll you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re the biggest &lsquo;draw&rsquo; in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shucks!&rdquo; she cried, out of her repertory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got into European society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have, maybe I haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
too soon to see.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell this season.&nbsp;
Every one says I&rsquo;ve got to wait till next, to see if
it&rsquo;s the same.&nbsp; Sometimes they take you right up for a
few weeks and then just drop you anywhere.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got
to make it a square thing somehow&mdash;to drive in a
nail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if it were your coffin,&rdquo; said
Littlemore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> a kind of coffin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
burying my past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced at this&mdash;he was tired to death of her
past.&nbsp; He changed the subject and turned her on to London, a
topic as to which her freshness of view and now unpremeditated
art of notation were really interesting, displayed as they were
at the expense of most of her new acquaintances and of some of
the most venerable features of the great city.&nbsp; He himself
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>looked
at England from the outside as much as it was possible to do; but
in the midst of her familiar allusions to people and things known
to her only since yesterday he was struck with the truth that she
would never really be initiated.&nbsp; She buzzed over the
surface of things like a fly on a window-pane.&nbsp; This surface
immensely pleased her; she was flattered, encouraged, excited;
she dropped her confident judgements as if she were scattering
flowers, talked about her intentions, her prospects, her
discoveries, her designs.&nbsp; But she had really learnt no more
about English life than about the molecular theory.&nbsp; The
words in which he had described her of old to Waterville came
back to him: &ldquo;<i>Elle ne doute de rien</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Suddenly she jumped up; she was going out to dine and it was time
to dress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before you leave I want you to promise me
something,&rdquo; she said off-hand, but with a look he had seen
before and that pressed on the point&mdash;oh so intensely!&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to be questioned about
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do people know I know you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;blown&rsquo; about it?&nbsp;
Is that what you mean?&nbsp; You can be a brute when you
try.&nbsp; They do know it at any rate.&nbsp; Possibly I may have
told them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll come to you to ask about me.&nbsp;
I mean from Lady Demesne.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in an awful
state.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so afraid of it&mdash;of the way he
wants me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In himself too, after all, she could still press the spring of
careless mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> not afraid, if you
haven&rsquo;t yet brought it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t make up his mind.&nbsp; I appeal
to him so, yet he can&rsquo;t quite place me where he&rsquo;d
have to have me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her lucidity and her detachment
were both grotesque and touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a poor creature if he won&rsquo;t take you
as you are.&nbsp; I mean for the sweet sake of what you
are,&rdquo; Littlemore added.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>This
wasn&rsquo;t a very gallant form, but she made the best of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&mdash;he wants to be very careful, and so
he ought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he asks too many questions he&rsquo;s not worth
marrying,&rdquo; Littlemore rather cheaply opined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;he&rsquo;s worth marrying
whatever he does; he&rsquo;s worth marrying for <i>me</i>.&nbsp;
And I want to marry him&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I want to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her old friend had a pause of some blankness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
he waiting for me to settle it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting for I don&rsquo;t know
what&mdash;for some one to come and tell him that I&rsquo;m the
sweetest of the sweet.&nbsp; Then he&rsquo;ll believe it.&nbsp;
Some one who has been out there and knows all about me.&nbsp; Of
course you&rsquo;re the man, you&rsquo;re created on
purpose.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember how I told you in Paris
he wanted to ask you?&nbsp; He was ashamed and gave it up; he
tried to forget me.&nbsp; But now it&rsquo;s all on
again&mdash;only meanwhile his mother has been at him.&nbsp; She
works night and day, like a weasel in a hole, to persuade him
that I&rsquo;m too much beneath him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very fond
of her and very open to influence; I mean from her&mdash;not from
any one else.&nbsp; Except me of course.&nbsp; Oh I&rsquo;ve
influenced him, I&rsquo;ve explained everything fifty times
over.&nbsp; But some memories, you know, are like those lumpish
or pointed things you can&rsquo;t get into your trunk&mdash;they
won&rsquo;t pack anyway; and he keeps coming back to them.&nbsp;
He wants every little speck explained.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t come
to you himself, but his mother will, or she&rsquo;ll send some of
her people.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;ll send the lawyer&mdash;the
family solicitor they call him.&nbsp; She wanted to send him out
to America to make inquiries, only she didn&rsquo;t know where to
send.&nbsp; Of course I couldn&rsquo;t be expected to give the
places&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got to find <i>them</i> out the best
way they can.&nbsp; She knows all about you and has made up to
your sister; a big proof, as she never <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>makes up to
any one.&nbsp; So you see how much I know.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
waiting for you; she means to hold you with her glittering
eye.&nbsp; She has an idea she <i>can</i>&mdash;can make you say
what&rsquo;ll meet her views.&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;ll lay it
before Sir Arthur.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ll be so good as to have
none&mdash;not a view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore had, however disguisedly, given her every
attention; but the conclusion left him all too consciously
staring.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that anything I can
say will make a difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be affected!&nbsp; You know it will as well
as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make him out not only a laggard in love but almost
a dastard in war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what I make him out.&nbsp; I guess if I can
understand him you can accept him.&nbsp; And I appeal to you
solemnly.&nbsp; You can save me or you can lose me.&nbsp; If you
lose me you&rsquo;ll be a coward.&nbsp; And if you say a word
against me I&rsquo;ll be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and dress for dinner&mdash;that&rsquo;s your
salvation,&rdquo; Littlemore returned as he quitted her at the
head of the stairs.</p>
<h3><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>IX</h3>
<p>It was very well for him to take that tone; but he felt as he
walked home that he should scarcely know what to say to people
who were determined, as she put it, to hold him with glittering
eyes.&nbsp; She had worked a certain spell; she had succeeded in
making him feel responsible.&nbsp; The sight of her success,
however, rather hardened his heart; he might have pitied her if
she had &ldquo;muffed&rdquo; it, as they said, but he just
sensibly resented her heavy scoring.&nbsp; He dined alone that
evening while his sister and her husband, who had engagements
every day for a month, partook of their repast at the expense of
friends.&nbsp; Mrs. Dolphin, however, came home rather early and
immediately sought admittance to the small apartment at the foot
of the staircase which was already spoken of as her
brother&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; Reggie had gone on to a
&ldquo;squash&rdquo; somewhere, and she had returned in her
eagerness to the third member of their party.&nbsp; She was too
impatient even to wait for morning.&nbsp; She looked impatient;
she was very unlike George Littlemore.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to
tell me about Mrs. Headway,&rdquo; she at once began, while he
started slightly at the coincidence of this remark with his own
thoughts.&nbsp; He was just making up his mind at last to speak
to her.&nbsp; She unfastened her cloak and tossed it over a
chair, then pulled off her long tight black gloves, which were
not so fine as those Mrs. Headway wore; all this as if she were
preparing <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>herself for an important interview.&nbsp; She was a
fair neat woman, who had once been pretty, with a small thin
voice, a finished manner and a perfect knowledge of what it was
proper to do on every occasion in life.&nbsp; She always did it,
and her conception of it was so definite that failure would have
left her without excuse.&nbsp; She was usually not taken for an
American, but she made a point of being one, because she
flattered herself that she was of a type which under that banner
borrowed distinction from rarity.&nbsp; She was by nature a great
conservative and had ended by figuring as a better Tory than her
husband; to the effect of being thought by some of her old
friends to have changed immensely since her marriage.&nbsp; She
knew English society as if she had compiled a red-covered
handbook of the subject; had a way of looking prepared for
far-reaching social action; had also thin lips and pretty teeth;
and was as positive as she was amiable.&nbsp; She told her
brother that Mrs. Headway had given out that he was her most
intimate friend; whereby she thought it rather odd he had never
spoken of her &ldquo;at home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Littlemore admitted,
on this, that he had known her a long time, referred to the
conditions in which the acquaintance had sprung up, and added
that he had seen her that afternoon.&nbsp; He sat there smoking
his cigar and looking up at the cornice while Mrs. Dolphin
delivered herself of a series of questions.&nbsp; Was it true
that he liked her so much, was it true he thought her a possible
woman to marry, was it true that her antecedents had not been
most peculiar?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well tell you I&rsquo;ve a letter from Lady
Demesne,&rdquo; his visitor went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It came to me
just before I went out, and I have it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew forth the missive, which she evidently wished to read
him; but he gave her no invitation to proceed.&nbsp; He knew she
had come to him to extract a <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>declaration adverse to Mrs.
Headway&rsquo;s projects, and however little edification he might
find in this lady&rsquo;s character he hated to be arraigned or
prodded.&nbsp; He had a great esteem for Mrs. Dolphin, who, among
other Hampshire notions, had picked up that of the major weight
of the male members of any family, so that she treated him with a
consideration which made his having an English sister rather a
luxury.&nbsp; Nevertheless he was not, on the subject of his old
Texan friend, very accommodating.&nbsp; He admitted once for all
that she hadn&rsquo;t behaved properly&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
worth while to split hairs about that; but he couldn&rsquo;t see
that she was much worse than lots of other women about the
place&mdash;women at once less amusing and less impugned; and he
couldn&rsquo;t get up much feeling about her marrying or not
marrying.&nbsp; Moreover, it was none of his business, and he
intimated that it was none of Mrs. Dolphin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One surely can&rsquo;t resist the claims of common
humanity!&rdquo; his sister replied; and she added that he was
very inconsistent.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t respect Mrs. Headway, he
knew the most dreadful things about her, he didn&rsquo;t think
her fit company for his own flesh and blood.&nbsp; And yet he was
willing not to save poor Arthur Demesne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly willing!&rdquo; Littlemore returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with saving others.&nbsp; All
I&rsquo;ve got to do is not to marry her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think then we&rsquo;ve any
responsibilities, any duties to society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&nbsp; Society can
look after itself.&nbsp; If she can bring it off she&rsquo;s
welcome.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a splendid sight in its way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean splendid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she has run up the tree as if she were a
squirrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very true she has an assurance <i>&agrave;
toute &eacute;preuve</i>.&nbsp; <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>But English society has become
scandalously easy.&nbsp; I never saw anything like the people who
are taken up.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway has had only to appear to
succeed.&nbsp; If they can only make out big <i>enough</i> spots
in you they&rsquo;ll find you attractive.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like
the decadence of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; You can see to look at
this person that she&rsquo;s not a lady.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
pretty, very pretty, but she might be a dissipated
dressmaker.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t go down for a minute in New
York.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen her three times&mdash;she apparently
goes everywhere.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t speak of her&mdash;I was
wanting to see what you&rsquo;d do.&nbsp; I judged you meant to
do nothing, then this letter decided me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s written
on purpose to be shown you; it&rsquo;s what the poor
lady&mdash;<i>such</i> a nice woman herself&mdash;wants you to
do.&nbsp; She wrote to me before I came to town, and I went to
see her as soon as I arrived.&nbsp; I think it very
important.&nbsp; I told her that if she&rsquo;d draw up a little
statement I&rsquo;d put it before you as soon as we should get
settled.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in real distress.&nbsp; I think you
ought to feel for her.&nbsp; You ought to communicate the facts
exactly as they stand.&nbsp; A woman has no right to do such
things as Mrs. Headway and come and ask to be accepted.&nbsp; She
may make it up with her conscience, but she can&rsquo;t make it
up with society.&nbsp; Last night at Lady Dovedale&rsquo;s I was
afraid she&rsquo;d know who I was and get somehow at me.&nbsp; I
believe she&rsquo;d really have been capable of it, and I got so
frightened I went away.&nbsp; If Sir Arthur wishes to marry her
for what she is, of course he&rsquo;s welcome.&nbsp; But at least
he ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dolphin was neither agitated nor voluble; she moved from
point to point with the temper and method of a person accustomed
to preside at committees and to direct them.&nbsp; She deeply
desired, however, that Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s triumphant career
should be checked; such a person had sufficiently abused <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>a tolerance
already so overstrained.&nbsp; Herself a party to an
international marriage, Mrs. Dolphin naturally desired the class
to which she belonged to close its ranks and carry its standard
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me she&rsquo;s quite as good as the poor
young man himself,&rdquo; said Littlemore, lighting another
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good?&nbsp; What do you mean by
&lsquo;good&rsquo;?&nbsp; No one has ever breathed a word against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a nonentity of the
first water, and she at least a positive quantity, not to say a
positive force.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a person, and a very clever
one.&nbsp; Besides, she&rsquo;s quite as good as the women lots
of them have married.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s new to me that your
alliances have been always so august.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about other cases,&rdquo; Mrs. Dolphin
said, &ldquo;I only know about this one.&nbsp; It so happens that
I&rsquo;ve been brought near it, and that an appeal has been made
to me.&nbsp; The English are very romantic&mdash;the most
romantic people in the world, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean.&nbsp; They do the strangest things from the force of
passion&mdash;even those of whom you would least expect it.&nbsp;
They marry their cooks, they marry their coachmen, and their
romances always have the most miserable end.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
this one would be wretched.&nbsp; How can you pretend that such a
flaming barbarian can be worked into <i>any</i>
civilisation?&nbsp; What I see is a fine old race&mdash;one of
the oldest and most honourable in England, people with every
tradition of good conduct and high principle&mdash;and a dreadful
disreputable vulgar little woman, who hasn&rsquo;t an idea of
what such things are, trying to force her way into it.&nbsp; I
hate to see such things&mdash;I want to go to the
rescue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Littlemore returned at his
leisure.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a pin for the fine old
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from interested motives, of course, any more <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>than
I.&nbsp; But surely on artistic grounds, on grounds of
decency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Headway isn&rsquo;t indecent&mdash;you go too
far.&nbsp; You must remember that she&rsquo;s an old friend of
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had become rather stern; Mrs. Dolphin was
forgetting the consideration due, from an English point of view,
to brothers.</p>
<p>She forgot it even a little more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh if
you&rsquo;re in love with her too!&rdquo; she quite wailed,
turning away.</p>
<p>He made no answer to this, and the words had no sting for
him.&nbsp; But at last, to finish the affair, he asked what in
the world the old lady wanted him to do.&nbsp; Did she want him
to go out into Piccadilly and announce to the passers-by that
there had been one winter when even Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s sister
didn&rsquo;t know who was her husband?</p>
<p>Mrs. Dolphin&rsquo;s reply was to read out Lady
Demesne&rsquo;s letter, which her brother, as she folded it up
again, pronounced one of the most extraordinary communications he
had ever listened to.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
sad&mdash;it&rsquo;s a cry of distress,&rdquo; she
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole meaning of it is that she wishes
you&rsquo;d come and see her.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t say it in
so many words, but I can read between the lines.&nbsp; Besides,
she told me she&rsquo;d give anything to see you.&nbsp; Let me
assure you it&rsquo;s your duty to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go and abuse Nancy Beck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and rave about her if you like!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was very clever of Mrs. Dolphin, but her brother was not so
easily beguiled.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t take that view of his
duty, and he declined to cross her ladyship&rsquo;s
threshold.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll come and see
you,&rdquo; said his visitor with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she does I&rsquo;ll tell her Nancy&rsquo;s an
angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can say so conscientiously she&rsquo;ll be
delighted to hear it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she gathered up her cloak
and gloves.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>Meeting Rupert Waterville the next day, as he often
did, at the Saint George&rsquo;s Club, which offers a
much-appreciated hospitality to secretaries of legation and to
the natives of the countries they assist in representing,
Littlemore let him know that his prophecy had been fulfilled and
that Lady Demesne had been making proposals for an
interview.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister read me a desperate letter from
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man was all critical attention again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Desperate&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter of a woman so scared that she&rsquo;ll do
anything.&nbsp; I may be a great brute, but her scare amuses
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the position of Olivier de Jalin in
<i>Le Demi-Monde</i>,&rdquo; Waterville remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>Le Demi-Monde</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Littlemore was
not quick at catching literary allusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the play we saw in
Paris?&nbsp; Or like Don Fabrice in
<i>L&rsquo;Aventuri&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; A bad woman tries to
marry an honourable man, who doesn&rsquo;t know how bad she is,
and they who do know step in and push her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it comes to me.&nbsp; There was a good deal of
lying,&rdquo; Littlemore recalled, &ldquo;all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They prevented the marriage, however&mdash;which is the
great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing if your heart&rsquo;s set!&nbsp; One of
the active parties was the intimate friend of the man in love,
the other was his son.&nbsp; Demesne&rsquo;s nothing at all to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good fellow,&rdquo; said
Waterville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go and talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play the part of Olivier de Jalin?&nbsp; Oh I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not Olivier.&nbsp; But I think I do
wish he&rsquo;d corner me of himself.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway
oughtn&rsquo;t really to be allowed to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven they&rsquo;d let me alone,&rdquo;
Littlemore <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>murmured ruefully and staring a while out of the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still hold to that theory you propounded in
Paris?&nbsp; Are you willing to commit perjury?&rdquo; Waterville
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly I can refuse to answer questions&mdash;even
that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you before, that will amount to a
condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Longmore frowningly debated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may amount to
what it pleases.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll go back to
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be the same as not answering.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s quite the best thing you can do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
really been thinking it out,&rdquo; Waterville continued,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t hold that from the point of view of
social good faith she&rsquo;s an article we ought to
contribute&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at the matter clearly
now from a great elevation; his tone, the expression of his face,
betrayed this lofty flight; the effect of which, as he glanced
down at his didactic young friend, Littlemore found peculiarly
irritating.</p>
<p>He shifted about.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, after all, hanged if they
shall drive me away!&rdquo; he exclaimed abruptly; and he walked
off while his companion wondered.</p>
<h3><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>X</h3>
<p>The morning after this the elder man received a note from Mrs.
Headway&mdash;a short and simple note, consisting merely of the
words: &ldquo;I shall be at home this afternoon; will you come
and see me at five?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve something particular to say
to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sent no answer to the question, but went
to the little house in Chesterfield Street at the hour its
mistress had proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know what sort of a woman I
<i>am</i>!&rdquo; she began as soon as he stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; Littlemore groaned as he dropped into a
chair.&nbsp; Then he added: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t strike up
<i>that</i> air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve wanted to
say.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very important.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
me&mdash;you don&rsquo;t understand me.&nbsp; You think you
do&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for the want of your having told
me&mdash;many many times!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Littlemore had a hard
critical smile, irritated as he was at so austere a
prospect.&nbsp; The last word of all was decidedly that Mrs.
Headway was a dreadful bore.&nbsp; It was always the last word
about such women, who never really deserved to be spared.</p>
<p>She glared at him a little on this; her face was no longer the
hospitable inn-front with the showy sign of the Smile.&nbsp; The
sign had come down; she looked <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>sharp and strained, almost old; the
change was complete.&nbsp; It made her serious as he had never
seen her&mdash;having seen her always only either too pleased or
too disgusted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I know; men are so stupid.&nbsp;
They know nothing about women but what women tell them.&nbsp; And
women tell them things on purpose to see how stupid they can
be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you things like that just for amusement
when it was dull.&nbsp; If you believed them it was your own
fault.&nbsp; But now I want you really to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know.&nbsp; I know
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean you know enough?&rdquo; she cried with
all her sincerity.&nbsp; &ldquo;What business have you to know
anything?&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor little woman, in her passionate
purpose, was not obliged to be consistent, and the loud laugh
with which Littlemore greeted this must have seemed to her unduly
harsh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall know what I want you to know,
however.&nbsp; You think me a bad woman&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
respect me; I told you that in Paris.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done
things I don&rsquo;t understand, myself, to-day; that I admit as
fully as you please.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve completely changed, and
I want to change everything.&nbsp; You ought to enter into that,
you ought to see what I want.&nbsp; I hate everything that has
happened to me before this; I loathe it, I despise it.&nbsp; I
went on that way trying&mdash;trying one thing and another.&nbsp;
But now I&rsquo;ve got what I want.&nbsp; Do you expect me to go
down on my knees to you?&nbsp; I believe I will, I&rsquo;m so
anxious.&nbsp; You can help me&mdash;no one else can do a thing;
they&rsquo;re only waiting to see if <i>he&rsquo;ll</i> do
it.&nbsp; I told you in Paris you could help me, and it&rsquo;s
just as true now.&nbsp; Say a good word for me for Christ&rsquo;s
sake!&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t lifted your little finger, or I
should know it by this time.&nbsp; It will just make the
difference.&nbsp; Or if your sister would come and see me I
should be all right.&nbsp; Women are pitiless, pitiless, and
you&rsquo;re pitiless too.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that Mrs.
Dolphin&rsquo;s <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>anything so great, most of my friends are better than
that!&mdash;but she&rsquo;s the one woman who <i>knows</i>, and
every one seems to know she knows.&nbsp; <i>He</i> knows it, and
he knows she doesn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; So she kills me&mdash;she
kills me!&nbsp; I understand perfectly what he
wants&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do everything, be anything, I&rsquo;ll be
the most perfect wife.&nbsp; The old woman will adore me when she
knows me&mdash;it&rsquo;s too stupid of her not to see.&nbsp;
Everything in the past&rsquo;s over; it has all fallen away from
me; it&rsquo;s the life of another woman.&nbsp; This was what I
wanted; I knew I should find it some day.&nbsp; I knew I should
be at home in the best&mdash;and with the highest.&nbsp; What
could I do in those horrible places?&nbsp; I had to take what I
could.&nbsp; But now I&rsquo;ve got nice surroundings.&nbsp; I
want you to do me justice.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve never done me
justice.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I sent for you for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore had suddenly ceased to be bored, but a variety of
feelings had taken the place of that one.&nbsp; It was impossible
not to be touched; she really meant what she said.&nbsp; People
don&rsquo;t change their nature, but they change their desires,
their ideal, their effort.&nbsp; This incoherent passionate plea
was an assurance that she was literally panting to be
respectable.&nbsp; But the poor woman, whatever she did, was
condemned, as he had said of old, in Paris, to Waterville, to be
only half right.&nbsp; The colour rose to her visitor&rsquo;s
face as he listened to her outpouring of anxiety and egotism; she
hadn&rsquo;t managed her early life very well, but there was no
need of her going down on her knees.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
painful to me to hear all this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re under no
obligation to say such things to me.&nbsp; You entirely
misconceive my attitude&mdash;my influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you shirk it&mdash;you only wish to shirk
it!&rdquo; she cried, flinging away fiercely the sofa-cushion on
which she had been resting.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>&ldquo;Marry whom you damn please!&rdquo; Littlemore
quite shouted, springing to his feet.</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when the door was thrown open and the
servant announced Sir Arthur Demesne.&nbsp; This shy adventurer
entered with a certain briskness, but stopped short on seeing
Mrs. Headway engaged with another guest.&nbsp; Recognising
Littlemore, however, he gave a light exclamation which might have
passed for a greeting.&nbsp; Mrs. Headway, who had risen as he
came in, looked with wonderful eyes from one of the men to the
other; then, like a person who had a sudden inspiration, she
clasped her hands together and cried out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
glad you&rsquo;ve met.&nbsp; If I had arranged it it
couldn&rsquo;t be better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had arranged it?&rdquo; said Sir Arthur,
crinkling a little his high white forehead, while the conviction
rose before Littlemore that she had indeed arranged it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something very
queer&rdquo;&mdash;and her extravagant manner confirmed her
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re excited, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re
ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Arthur stood there with his hat and his
stick; he was evidently much annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an excellent opportunity; you must forgive
me if I take advantage.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she flashed a tender
touching ray at the Baronet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted this
a long time&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen I wanted it.&nbsp;
Mr. Littlemore has known me from far back; he&rsquo;s an old old
friend.&nbsp; I told you that in Paris, don&rsquo;t you
remember?&nbsp; Well he&rsquo;s my only one, and I want him to
speak for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes had turned now to Littlemore;
they rested upon him with a sweetness that only made the whole
proceeding more audacious.&nbsp; She had begun to smile again,
though she was visibly trembling.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my only
one,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great pity, you
ought to have known others.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m very much alone
and must make the best of <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>what I have.&nbsp; I want so much
that some one else than myself should speak for me.&nbsp; Women
usually can ask that service of a relative or of another
woman.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s a great pity, but
it&rsquo;s not my fault, it&rsquo;s my misfortune.&nbsp; None of
my people are here&mdash;I&rsquo;m terribly alone in the
world.&nbsp; But Mr. Littlemore will tell you; he&rsquo;ll say he
has known me for ever so long.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll tell you if he
knows any reason&mdash;if there&rsquo;s anything against
me.&nbsp; He has been wanting the chance&mdash;he thought he
couldn&rsquo;t begin himself.&nbsp; You see I treat you as an old
friend, dear Mr. Littlemore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave you with Sir
Arthur.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll both excuse me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
expression of her face, turned towards Littlemore as she
delivered herself of this singular proposal, had the intentness
of a magician who wishes to work a spell.&nbsp; She darted at Sir
Arthur another pleading ray and then swept out of the room.</p>
<p>The two men remained in the extraordinary position she had
created for them; neither of them moved even to open the door for
her.&nbsp; She closed it behind her, and for a moment there was a
deep portentous silence.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Demesne, very pale,
stared hard at the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m placed in an impossible situation,&rdquo;
Littlemore said at last, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t imagine you
accept it any more than I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; His fellow-visitor
kept the same attitude, neither looking up nor answering.&nbsp;
Littlemore felt a sudden gush of pity for him.&nbsp; Of course he
couldn&rsquo;t accept the situation, but all the same he was
half-sick with anxiety to see how this nondescript American, who
was both so precious and so superfluous, so easy and so abysmal,
would consider Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s challenge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you any question to ask me?&rdquo; Littlemore went on.&nbsp; At
which Sir Arthur looked up.&nbsp; The other had seen the look
before; he had described it to Waterville after Mrs.
Headway&rsquo;s admirer came to call on him in Paris.&nbsp; There
were <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>other things mingled with it now&mdash;shame,
annoyance, pride; but the great thing, the intense desire to
<i>know</i>, was paramount.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good God, how can I tell
him?&rdquo; seemed to hum in Littlemore&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur&rsquo;s hesitation would have been of the briefest;
but his companion heard the tick of the clock while it
lasted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ve no question to
ask,&rdquo; the young man said in a voice of cool almost insolent
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day then, confound you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Littlemore left him in possession.&nbsp; He expected to
find Mrs. Headway at the foot of the staircase; but he quitted
the house without interruption.</p>
<p>On the morrow, after luncheon, as he was leaving the vain
retreat at Queen Anne&rsquo;s Gate, the postman handed him a
letter.&nbsp; Littlemore opened and read it on the steps, an
operation which took but a moment.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
Littlemore</span>&mdash;It will interest you to know that
I&rsquo;m engaged to be married to Sir Arthur Demesne and that
our marriage is to take place as soon as their stupid old
Parliament rises.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not to come out for some
days, and I&rsquo;m sure I can trust meanwhile to your complete
discretion.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Nancy H.</span></p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;He made me a terrible scene for what I did
yesterday, but he came back in the evening and we fixed it all
right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how the thing comes to be
settled.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t tell me what passed between
you&mdash;he requested me never to allude to the subject.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I was bound you should speak!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Littlemore thrust this epistle into his pocket and marched
away with it.&nbsp; He had come out on various errands, but he
forgot his business for the time and <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>before he knew it had walked into
Hyde Park.&nbsp; He left the carriages and riders to one side and
followed the Serpentine into Kensington Gardens, of which he made
the complete circuit.&nbsp; He felt annoyed, and more
disappointed than he understood&mdash;than he would have
understood if he had tried.&nbsp; Now that Nancy Beck had
succeeded her success was an irritation, and he was almost sorry
he hadn&rsquo;t said to Sir Arthur: &ldquo;Oh well, she was
pretty bad, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, now they were at one
they would perhaps leave him alone.&nbsp; He walked the
irritation off and before he went about his original purposes had
ceased to think of Mrs. Headway.&nbsp; He went home at six
o&rsquo;clock, and the servant who admitted him informed him in
doing so that Mrs. Dolphin had requested he should be told on his
return that she wished to see him in the drawing-room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another trap!&rdquo; he said to himself
instinctively; but in spite of this reflexion he went
upstairs.&nbsp; On entering his sister&rsquo;s presence he found
she had a visitor.&nbsp; This visitor, to all appearance on the
point of departing, was a tall elderly woman, and the two ladies
stood together in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Dolphin without meeting her brother&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want so much to introduce you to Lady Demesne that I
hoped you&rsquo;d come in.&nbsp; Must you really
go&mdash;won&rsquo;t you stay a little?&rdquo; she added, turning
to her companion; and without waiting for an answer went on
hastily: &ldquo;I must leave you a moment&mdash;excuse me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll come back!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before he knew it Littlemore
found himself alone with her ladyship and understood that since
he hadn&rsquo;t been willing to go and see her she had taken upon
herself to make an advance.&nbsp; It had the queerest effect, all
the same, to see his sister playing the same tricks as Nancy
Beck!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she must be in a fidget!&rdquo; he said to himself
as he stood before Lady Demesne.&nbsp; She looked modest <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and aloof,
even timid, as far as a tall serene woman who carried her head
very well could look so; and she was such a different type from
Mrs. Headway that his present vision of Nancy&rsquo;s triumph
gave her by contrast something of the dignity of the
vanquished.&nbsp; It made him feel as sorry for her as he had
felt for her son.&nbsp; She lost no time; she went straight to
the point.&nbsp; She evidently felt that in the situation in
which she had placed herself her only advantage could consist in
being simple and business-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fortunate as to catch you.&nbsp; I wish so
much to ask you if you can give me any information about a person
you know and about whom I have been in correspondence with Mrs.
Dolphin.&nbsp; I mean Mrs. Headway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; asked Littlemore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask you why you make this inquiry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I must give you my reason.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
afraid my son will marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Littlemore was puzzled&mdash;then saw she wasn&rsquo;t yet
aware of the fact imparted to him in Mrs. Headway&rsquo;s
note.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like her?&rdquo; he asked,
exaggerating, in spite of himself, the interrogative
inflexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Lady Demesne, smiling and
looking at him.&nbsp; Her smile was gentle, without rancour; he
thought it almost beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like me to say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether you think her respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will that do you?&nbsp; How can it possibly
affect the event?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do me no good, of course, if your
opinion&rsquo;s favourable.&nbsp; But if you tell me it&rsquo;s
not I shall be able to say to my son that the one person in
London who has known her more than six months thinks so and so of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>This
speech, on Lady Demesne&rsquo;s clear lips, evoked no protest
from her listener.&nbsp; He had suddenly become conscious of the
need to utter the simple truth with which he had answered Rupert
Waterville&rsquo;s first question at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais.&nbsp; He brought it out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think Mrs. Headway respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you would say that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She seemed
to pant a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can say nothing more&mdash;not a word.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my opinion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it will help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will.&nbsp; I wanted to have it from your
own lips.&nbsp; That makes all the difference,&rdquo; said Lady
Demesne.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m exceedingly obliged to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she offered him her hand; after which he
accompanied her in silence to the door.</p>
<p>He felt no discomfort, no remorse, at what he had said; he
only felt relief&mdash;presumably because he believed it would
make no difference.&nbsp; It made a difference only in what was
at the bottom of all things&mdash;his own sense of fitness.&nbsp;
He only wished he had driven it home that Mrs. Headway would
probably be for her son a capital wife.&nbsp; But that at least
would make no difference.&nbsp; He requested his sister, who had
wondered greatly at the brevity of his interview with her friend,
to spare him all questions on the subject; and Mrs. Dolphin went
about for some days in the happy faith that there were to be no
dreadful Americans in English society compromising her native
land.</p>
<p>Her faith, however, was short-lived.&nbsp; Nothing had made
any difference; it was perhaps too late.&nbsp; The London world
heard in the first days of July, not that Sir Arthur Demesne was
to marry Mrs. Headway, but that the pair had been privately and,
it was to be hoped as regards Mrs. Headway on this occasion,
indissolubly united.&nbsp; His mother gave neither sign nor
sound; she only retired to the country.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;I think you might have done differently,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Dolphin, very pale, to her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of
course everything will come out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and make her more the fashion than ever!&rdquo;
Littlemore answered with cynical laughter.&nbsp; After his little
interview with the elder Lady Demesne he didn&rsquo;t feel at
liberty to call again on the younger; and he never
learned&mdash;he never even wished to know&mdash;whether in the
pride of her success she forgave him.</p>
<p>Waterville&mdash;it was very strange&mdash;was positively
scandalised at this success.&nbsp; He held that Mrs. Headway
ought never to have been allowed to marry a confiding gentleman,
and he used in speaking to Littlemore the same words as Mrs.
Dolphin.&nbsp; He thought Littlemore might have done
differently.&nbsp; But he spoke with such vehemence that
Littlemore looked at him hard&mdash;hard enough to make him
blush.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you want to marry her yourself?&rdquo;
his friend inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow, you&rsquo;re in
love with her!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, however, blushing still more, Waterville indignantly
denied.&nbsp; A little later he heard from New York that people
were beginning to ask who in the world Lady Demesne &ldquo;had
been.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>AN
INTERNATIONAL EPISODE</h2>
<h3><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>I</h3>
<p>Four years ago&mdash;in 1874&mdash;two young Englishmen had
occasion to go to the United States.&nbsp; They crossed the ocean
at midsummer and, arriving in New York on the first day of
August, were much struck with the high, the torrid
temperature.&nbsp; Disembarking upon the wharf they climbed into
one of the huge high-hung coaches that convey passengers to the
hotels, and with a great deal of bouncing and bumping they took
their course through Broadway.&nbsp; The midsummer aspect of New
York is doubtless not the most engaging, though nothing perhaps
could well more solicit an alarmed attention.&nbsp; Of quite
other sense and sound from those of any typical English street
was the endless rude channel, rich in incongruities, through
which our two travellers advanced&mdash;looking out on either
side at the rough animation of the sidewalks, at the
high-coloured heterogeneous architecture, at the huge white
marble fa&ccedil;ades that, bedizened with gilded lettering,
seemed to glare in the strong crude light, at the multifarious
awnings, banners and streamers, at the extraordinary number of
omnibuses, horse-cars and other democratic vehicles, at the
vendors of cooling fluids, the white trousers and big straw hats
of the policemen, the tripping gait of the modish young persons
on the pavement, the general brightness, newness, juvenility,
both of people and things.&nbsp; The young men had <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>exchanged
few observations, but in crossing Union Square, in front of the
monument to Washington&mdash;in the very shadow indeed projected
by the image of the <i>pater patriae</i>&mdash;one of them
remarked to the other: &ldquo;Awfully rum place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, very odd, very odd,&rdquo; said the other, who was
the clever man of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity it&rsquo;s so beastly hot,&rdquo; resumed the
first speaker after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re in a low latitude,&rdquo; said the
clever man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; remarked his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the second speaker presently,
&ldquo;if they can give one a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; the other returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; cried his comrade.</p>
<p>This animated discussion dropped on their arrival at the
hotel, recommended to them by an American gentleman whose
acquaintance they had made&mdash;with whom, indeed, they had
become very intimate&mdash;on the steamer and who had proposed to
accompany them to the inn and introduce them in a friendly way to
the proprietor.&nbsp; This plan, however, had been defeated by
their friend&rsquo;s finding his &ldquo;partner&rdquo; in earnest
attendance on the wharf, with urgent claims on his immediate
presence of mind.&nbsp; But the two Englishmen, with nothing
beyond their national prestige and personal graces to recommend
them, were very well received at the hotel, which had an air of
capacious hospitality.&nbsp; They found a bath not unattainable
and were indeed struck with the facilities for prolonged and
reiterated immersion with which their apartment was
supplied.&nbsp; After bathing a good deal&mdash;more indeed than
they had ever done before on a single occasion&mdash;they made
their way to the dining-room of the hotel, which was a spacious
restaurant with a fountain in the middle, a great many <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>tall plants
in ornamental tubs and an array of French waiters.&nbsp; The
first dinner on land, after a sea-voyage, is in any connexion a
delightful hour, and there was much that ministered to ease in
the general situation of our young men.&nbsp; They were formed
for good spirits and addicted and appointed to hilarity; they
were more observant than they appeared; they were, in an
inarticulate accidentally dissimulative fashion, capable of high
appreciation.&nbsp; This was perhaps especially the case with the
elder, who was also, as I have said, the man of talent.&nbsp;
They sat down at a little table which was a very different affair
from the great clattering see-saw in the saloon of the
steamer.&nbsp; The wide doors and windows of the restaurant stood
open, beneath large awnings, to a wide expanse studded with other
plants in tubs and rows of spreading trees&mdash;beyond which
appeared a large shady square without palings and with
marble-paved walks.&nbsp; And above the vivid verdure rose other
fa&ccedil;ades of white marble and of pale chocolate-coloured
stone, squaring themselves against the deep blue sky.&nbsp; Here,
outside, in the light and the shade and the heat, was a great
tinkling of the bells of innumerable street-cars and a constant
strolling and shuffling and rustling of many pedestrians,
extremely frequent among whom were young women in
Pompadour-looking dresses.&nbsp; The place within was cool and
vaguely lighted; with the plash of water, the odour of flowers
and the flitting of French waiters, as I have said, on soundless
carpets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather like Paris, you know,&rdquo; said the
younger of our two travellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Paris&mdash;only more so,&rdquo; his
companion returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the French waiters,&rdquo; said
the first speaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they have French
waiters in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;Ah, but fancy a French waiter at a London
club!&rdquo; said his friend.</p>
<p>The elder man stared as if he couldn&rsquo;t fancy it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In Paris I&rsquo;m very apt to dine at a place where
there&rsquo;s an English waiter.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know,
what&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s, close to the thingumbob?&nbsp;
They always set an English waiter at me.&nbsp; I suppose they
think I can&rsquo;t speak French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more you can!&rdquo;&nbsp; And this candid critic
unfolded his napkin.</p>
<p>The other paid no heed whatever to his candour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
say,&rdquo; the latter resumed in a moment, &ldquo;I suppose we
must learn to speak American.&nbsp; I suppose we must take
lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make them out, you know,&rdquo; said the
clever man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is <i>he</i> saying?&rdquo; asked his
comrade, appealing from the French waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s recommending some soft-shell crabs,&rdquo;
said the clever man.</p>
<p>And so, in a desultory view of the mysteries of the new world
bristling about them, the young Englishmen proceeded to
dine&mdash;going in largely, as the phrase is, for cooling
draughts and dishes, as to which their attendant submitted to
them a hundred alternatives.&nbsp; After dinner they went out and
slowly walked about the neighbouring streets.&nbsp; The early
dusk of waning summer was at hand, but the heat still very
great.&nbsp; The pavements were hot even to the stout boot-soles
of the British travellers, and the trees along the kerb-stone
emitted strange exotic odours.&nbsp; The young men wandered
through the adjoining square&mdash;that queer place without
palings and with marble walks arranged in black and white
lozenges.&nbsp; There were a great many benches crowded with
shabby-looking people, and the visitors remarked very justly that
it wasn&rsquo;t much like Grosvenor Square.&nbsp; <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>On one side
was an enormous hotel, lifting up into the hot darkness an
immense array of open and brightly-lighted windows.&nbsp; At the
base of this populous structure was an eternal jangle of
horse-cars, and all round it, in the upper dusk, a sinister hum
of mosquitoes.&nbsp; The ground-floor of the hotel, figuring a
huge transparent cage, flung a wide glare of gaslight into the
street, of which it formed a public adjunct, absorbing and
emitting the passers-by promiscuously.&nbsp; The young Englishmen
went in with every one else, from curiosity, and saw a couple of
hundred men sitting on divans along a great marble-paved
corridor, their legs variously stretched out, together with
several dozen more standing in a queue, as at the ticket-office
of a railway station, before a vast marble altar of sacrifice, a
thing shaped like the counter of a huge shop.&nbsp; These latter
persons, who carried portmanteaus in their hands, had a dejected
exhausted look; their garments were not fresh, as if telling of
some rush, or some fight, for life, and they seemed to render
mystic tribute to a magnificent young man with a waxed moustache
and a shirt front adorned with diamond buttons, who every now and
then dropped a cold glance over their multitudinous
patience.&nbsp; They were American citizens doing homage to an
hotel-clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t tell us to go
there,&rdquo; said one of our Englishmen, alluding to their
friend on the steamer, who had told them so many things.&nbsp;
They walked up the Fifth Avenue, where he had, for instance, told
them all the first families lived.&nbsp; But the first families
were out of town, and our friends had but the satisfaction of
seeing some of the second&mdash;or perhaps even the
third&mdash;taking the evening air on balconies and high flights
of doorsteps in streets at right angles to the main straight
channel.&nbsp; They went a little way down one of these
side-streets and there <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>saw young ladies in white
dresses&mdash;charming-looking persons&mdash;seated in graceful
attitudes on the chocolate-coloured steps.&nbsp; In one or two
places these young ladies were conversing across the street with
other young ladies seated in similar postures and costumes in
front of the opposite houses, and in the warm night air their
colloquial tones sounded strangely in the ears of the young
Englishmen.&nbsp; One of the latter, nevertheless&mdash;the
younger&mdash;betrayed a disposition to intercept some stray item
of this interchange and see what it would lead to; but his
companion observed pertinently enough that he had better be
careful.&nbsp; They mustn&rsquo;t begin by making mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he told us, you know&mdash;he told us,&rdquo; urged
the young man, alluding again to the friend on the steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what he told us!&rdquo; answered his elder,
who, if he had more years and a more developed wit, was also
apparently more of a moralist.</p>
<p>By bedtime&mdash;in their impatience to taste of a terrestrial
couch again our seafarers went to bed early&mdash;it was still
insufferably hot, and the buzz of the mosquitoes at the open
windows might have passed for an audible crepitation of the
temperature.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand this, you
know,&rdquo; the young Englishmen said to each other; and they
tossed about all night more boisterously than they had been
tossed by Atlantic billows.&nbsp; On the morrow their first
thought was that they would re-embark that day for England, but
it then occurred to them they might find an asylum nearer at
hand.&nbsp; The cave of &AElig;olus became their ideal of
comfort, and they wondered where the Americans went when wishing
to cool off.&nbsp; They hadn&rsquo;t the least idea, and resolved
to apply for information to Mr. J. L. Westgate.&nbsp; This was
the name&mdash;inscribed in a bold hand on the back of a letter
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>carefully preserved in the pocket-book of our younger
gentleman.&nbsp; Beneath the address, in the left-hand corner of
the envelope, were the words &ldquo;Introducing Lord Lambeth and
Percy Beaumont Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter had been given to the
two Englishmen by a good friend of theirs in London, who had been
in America two years previously and had singled out Mr. J. L.
Westgate from the many friends he had left there as the
consignee, as it were, of his compatriots.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really very decent,&rdquo; the Englishman in
London had said, &ldquo;and he has an awfully pretty wife.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s tremendously hospitable&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do
everything in the world for you, and as he knows every one over
there it&rsquo;s quite needless I should give you any other
introduction.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll make you see every
one&mdash;trust him for the right kick-off.&nbsp; He has a
tremendously pretty wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was natural that in the
hour of tribulation Lord Lambeth and Mr. Percy Beaumont should
have bethought themselves of so possible a benefactor; all the
more so that he lived in the Fifth Avenue and that the Fifth
Avenue, as they had ascertained the night before, was contiguous
to their hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ten to one he&rsquo;ll be out of
town,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont; &ldquo;but we can at least find
out where he has gone and can at once give chase.&nbsp; He
can&rsquo;t possibly have gone to a hotter place, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s only one hotter place,&rdquo; said
Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;and I hope he hasn&rsquo;t gone
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They strolled along the shady side of the street to the number
indicated by the precious letter.&nbsp; The house presented an
imposing chocolate-coloured expanse, relieved by facings and
window-cornices of florid sculpture and by a couple of dusty
rose-trees which clambered over the balconies and the
portico.&nbsp; This last-mentioned feature was approached by a
monumental flight of steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather better than a dirty London thing,&rdquo; said <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>Lord
Lambeth, looking down from this altitude after they had rung the
bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon what London thing you mean,&rdquo;
replied his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a tremendous
chance to get wet between the house-door and your
carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, glancing at the blaze
of the sky, &ldquo;I &lsquo;guess&rsquo; it doesn&rsquo;t rain so
much here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was opened by a long negro in a white jacket, who
grinned familiarly when Lord Lambeth asked for Mr.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t at home, sir; he&rsquo;s
down town at his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh at his office?&rdquo; said the visitors.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And when will he be at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when he goes out dis way in de mo&rsquo;ning he
ain&rsquo;t liable to come home all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was discouraging; but the address of Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s
office was freely imparted by the intelligent black and was taken
down by Percy Beaumont in his pocket-book.&nbsp; The comrades
then returned, languidly enough, to their hotel and sent for a
hackney-coach; and in this commodious vehicle they rolled
comfortably down town.&nbsp; They measured the whole length of
Broadway again and found it a path of fire; and then, deflecting
to the left, were deposited by their conductor before a fresh
light ornamental structure, ten stories high, in a street crowded
with keen-faced light-limbed young men who were running about
very nimbly and stopping each other eagerly at corners and in
doorways.&nbsp; Passing under portals that were as the course of
a twofold torrent, they were introduced by one of the keen-faced
young men&mdash;he was a charming fellow in wonderful
cream-coloured garments and a hat with a blue ribbon, who had
evidently recognised them as aliens and helpless&mdash;to a very
snug hydraulic elevator, in which they took their place with many
other persons and which, <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>shooting upward in its vertical
socket, presently projected them into the seventh heaven, as it
were, of the edifice.&nbsp; Here, after brief delay, they found
themselves face to face with the friend of their friend in
London.&nbsp; His office was composed of several conjoined rooms,
and they waited very silently in one of these after they had sent
in their letter and their cards.&nbsp; The letter was not one it
would take Mr. Westgate very long to read, but he came out to
speak to them more instantly than they could have expected; he
had evidently jumped up from work.&nbsp; He was a tall lean
personage and was dressed all in fresh white linen; he had a thin
sharp familiar face, a face suggesting one of the ingenious
modern objects with alternative uses, good as a blade or as a
hammer, good for the deeps and for the shallows.&nbsp; His
forehead was high but expressive, his eyes sharp but amused, and
a large brown moustache, which concealed his mouth, made his
chin, beneath it, look small.&nbsp; Relaxed though he was at this
moment Lord Lambeth judged him on the spot tremendously
clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Lord Lambeth, how do you do,
sir?&rdquo;&mdash;he held the open letter in his hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to meet you&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;re
very well.&nbsp; You had better come in here&mdash;I think
it&rsquo;s cooler&rdquo;; and he led the way into another room,
where there were law-books and papers and where windows opened
wide under striped awnings.&nbsp; Just opposite one of the
windows, on a line with his eyes, Lord Lambeth observed the
weather-vane of a church-steeple.&nbsp; The uproar of the street
sounded infinitely far below, and his lordship felt high indeed
in the air.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s cooler,&rdquo; pursued
their host, &ldquo;but everything&rsquo;s relative.&nbsp; How do
you stand the heat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say we like it,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth;
&ldquo;but Beaumont likes it better than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it will break,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>cheerfully
declared; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s never anything bad over here but
it does break.&nbsp; It was very hot when Captain Littledale was
here; he did nothing but drink sherry-cobblers.&nbsp; He
expresses some doubt in his letter whether I shall remember
him&mdash;as if I don&rsquo;t remember once mixing six
sherry-cobblers for him in about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; I hope
you left him well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be glad to mix him some
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he&rsquo;s all right&mdash;and without
<i>them</i>,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always very glad to see your
countrymen,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought
it would be time some of you should be coming along.&nbsp; A
friend of mine was saying to me only a day or two ago,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for the water-melons and the
Englishmen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Englishmen and the water-melons just now are about
the same thing,&rdquo; Percy Beaumont observed with a wipe of his
dripping forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, we&rsquo;ll put you on ice as we do the
melons.&nbsp; You must go down to Newport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go anywhere!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you want to go to Newport; that&rsquo;s what you
want to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Westgate was very positive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s see&mdash;when did you get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only yesterday,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, by the <i>Russia</i>.&nbsp; Where are you
staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Hanover, I think they call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty comfortable?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a capital place, but I can&rsquo;t say we like
the gnats,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Westgate stared and laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no, of course
you don&rsquo;t like the gnats.&nbsp; We shall expect you to like
a good many things over here, but we shan&rsquo;t insist on your
liking the gnats; though certainly you&rsquo;ll admit that, as
gnats, they&rsquo;re big things, eh?&nbsp; But you oughtn&rsquo;t
to remain in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;So we think,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d kindly suggest something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suggest something, my dear sir?&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr.
Westgate looked him over with narrowed eyelids.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open
your mouth and shut your eyes!&nbsp; Leave it to me and
I&rsquo;ll fix you all right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a matter of
national pride with me that all Englishmen should have a good
time, and as I&rsquo;ve been through a good deal with them
I&rsquo;ve learned to minister to their wants.&nbsp; I find they
generally want the true thing.&nbsp; So just please consider
yourselves my property; and if any one should try to appropriate
you please say, &lsquo;Hands off&mdash;too late for the
market.&rsquo;&nbsp; But let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; continued the
American with his face of toil, his voice of leisure and his
general intention, apparently, of everything; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
see: are you going to make something of a stay, Lord
Lambeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; said the young Englishman; &ldquo;my
cousin was to make this little visit, so I just came with him, at
an hour&rsquo;s notice, for the lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your first time over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was obliged to come on some business,&rdquo; Percy
Beaumont explained, &ldquo;and I brought Lambeth along for
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> have been here before, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought from your referring to business&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Westgate threw off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you see I&rsquo;m just acting for some English
shareholders by way of legal advice.&nbsp; Some of my
friends&mdash;well, if the truth must be told,&rdquo; Mr.
Beaumont laughed&mdash;&ldquo;have a grievance against one of
your confounded railways, and they&rsquo;ve asked me to come and
judge, if possible, on the spot, what they can hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s amused eyes grew almost tender.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your railroad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;The Tennessee Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American tilted back his chair and poised it an
instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry you want to attack
one of our institutions.&nbsp; But I guess you had better enjoy
yourself <i>first</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly rather afraid I can&rsquo;t work in
this weather,&rdquo; the young emissary confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to the natives,&rdquo; said Mr.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave the Tennessee Central to me, Mr.
Beaumont.&nbsp; I guess I can tell you more about it than most
any one.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t know you Englishmen ever did
any work&mdash;in the upper classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh we do a lot of work, don&rsquo;t we, Lambeth?&rdquo;
Percy Beaumont appealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must certainly be back early for <i>my</i>
engagements,&rdquo; said his companion irrelevantly but
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the shooting, eh? or is it the yachting or the
hunting or the fishing?&rdquo; inquired his entertainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I must be in Scotland,&rdquo;&mdash;and Lord Lambeth
just amiably blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate returned, &ldquo;you
had better amuse yourself first also.&nbsp; You must go right
down and see Mrs. Westgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be so happy&mdash;if you&rsquo;d kindly tell
us the train,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take any train.&nbsp; You take a
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I see.&nbsp; And what is the name
of&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;a&mdash;town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular old city&mdash;don&rsquo;t you let
them hear you call it a village or a hamlet or anything of that
kind.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d half-kill you.&nbsp; Only it&rsquo;s a
city of pleasure&mdash;of lawns and gardens and verandahs and
views and, above all, of good Samaritans,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate
developed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll see what Newport
is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s cool.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the principal
thing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll greatly oblige me by going down there
and putting yourself in the hands of Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>perhaps for me to say it, but you couldn&rsquo;t be in
better ones.&nbsp; Also in those of her sister, who&rsquo;s
staying with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s half-crazy about
Englishmen.&nbsp; She thinks there&rsquo;s nothing like
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Westgate or&mdash;a&mdash;her sister?&rdquo; asked
Percy Beaumont modestly, yet in the tone of a collector of
characteristic facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I mean my wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose my sister-in-law knows much about
them yet.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll show her anyhow.&nbsp; She has
always led a very quiet life.&nbsp; She has lived in
Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Beaumont listened with interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;That, I
believe, is the most intellectual centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;Boston knows it&rsquo;s central and
feels it&rsquo;s intellectual.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go there
much&mdash;I stay round here,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate more loosely
pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you know, <i>we</i> ought to go there,&rdquo;
Lord Lambeth broke out to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord Lambeth, wait till the great heat&rsquo;s
over!&rdquo; Mr. Westgate interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boston in this
weather would be very trying; it&rsquo;s not the temperature for
intellectual exertion.&nbsp; At Boston, you know, you have to
pass an examination at the city limits, and when you come away
they give you a kind of degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth flushed himself, in his charming way, with
wonder, though his friend glanced to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t
looking too credulous&mdash;they had heard so much about American
practices.&nbsp; He decided in time, at any rate, to take a safe
middle course.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s very
jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it is,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only I must impress on you that at present&mdash;to-morrow
morning at an early hour&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be expected at
Newport.&nbsp; We have a house there&mdash;many of our most
prominent citizens and society leaders go there for the
summer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure that at this very moment my <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>wife can
take you in&mdash;she has a lot of people staying with her.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know who they all are&mdash;only she may have no
room.&nbsp; But you can begin with the hotel and meanwhile you
can live at my house.&nbsp; In that way&mdash;simply sleeping at
the hotel&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find it tolerable.&nbsp; For the
rest you must make yourself at home at my place.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t be shy, you know; if you&rsquo;re only here for a
month that will be a great waste of time.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate
won&rsquo;t neglect you, and you had better not undertake to
resist her.&nbsp; I know something about that.&nbsp; I guess
you&rsquo;ll find some pretty girls on the premises.&nbsp; I
shall write to my wife by this afternoon&rsquo;s mail, and
to-morrow she and Miss Alden will look out for you.&nbsp; Just
walk right in and get into touch.&nbsp; Your steamer leaves from
this part of the city, and I&rsquo;ll send right out and get you
a cabin.&nbsp; Then at half-past four o&rsquo;clock just call for
me here, and I&rsquo;ll go with you and put you on board.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a big boat; you might get lost.&nbsp; A few days
hence, at the end of the week, I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ll
come down myself and see how you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young Englishmen inaugurated the policy of not
resisting Mrs. Westgate by submitting, with great docility and
thankfulness, to her husband.&nbsp; He was evidently a clear
thinker, and he made an impression on his visitors; his
hospitality seemed to recommend itself consciously&mdash;with a
friendly wink, as might be, hinting judicially that you
couldn&rsquo;t make a better bargain.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth and his
cousin left their entertainer to his labours and returned to
their hotel, where they spent three or four hours in their
respective shower-baths.&nbsp; Percy Beaumont had suggested that
they ought to see something of the town, but &ldquo;Oh damn the
town!&rdquo; his noble kinsman had rejoined.&nbsp; They returned
to Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s office in a carriage, with their luggage,
very punctually; but it must be reluctantly recorded that this
time <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>he
so kept them waiting that they felt themselves miss their
previous escape and were deterred only by an amiable modesty from
dispensing with his attendance and starting on a hasty scramble
to embark.&nbsp; But when at last he appeared and the carriage
plunged into the purlieus of Broadway they jolted and jostled to
such good purpose that they reached the huge white vessel while
the bell for departure was still ringing and the absorption of
passengers still active.&nbsp; It was indeed, as Mr. Westgate had
said, a big boat, and his leadership in the innumerable and
interminable corridors and cabins, with which he seemed perfectly
acquainted and of which any one and every one appeared to have
the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, was very grateful to the slightly
bewildered voyagers.&nbsp; He showed them their
state-room&mdash;a luxurious retreat embellished with gas-lamps,
mirrors <i>en pied</i> and florid furniture&mdash;and then, long
after they had been intimately convinced that the steamer was in
motion and launched upon the unknown stream they were about to
navigate, he bade them a sociable farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goodbye, Mr. Percy Beaumont.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll
have a good time.&nbsp; Just let them do what they want with
you.&nbsp; Take it as it&rsquo;s meant.&nbsp; Renounce your own
personality.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come down by and by and enjoy
what&rsquo;s left of you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>II</h3>
<p>The young Englishmen emerged from their cabin and amused
themselves with wandering about the immense labyrinthine ship,
which struck them as a monstrous floating hotel or even as a
semi-submerged kindergarten.&nbsp; It was densely crowded with
passengers, the larger number of whom appeared to be ladies and
very young children; and in the big saloons, ornamented in white
and gold, which followed each other in surprising succession,
beneath the swinging gas-lights and among the small side-passages
where the negro domestics of both sexes assembled with an air of
amused criticism, every one was moving to and fro and exchanging
loud and familiar observations.&nbsp; Eventually, at the instance
of a blackamoor more closely related to the scene than his
companions, our friends went and had &ldquo;supper&rdquo; in a
wonderful place arranged like a theatre, where, from a gilded
gallery upon which little boxes appeared to open, a large
orchestra played operatic selections and, below, people handed
about bills of fare in the manner of programmes.&nbsp; All this
was sufficiently curious; but the agreeable thing, later, was to
sit out on one of the great white decks in the warm breezy
darkness and, the vague starlight aiding, make out the line of
low mysterious coast.&nbsp; Our travellers tried American
cigars&mdash;those of Mr. Westgate&mdash;and conversed, as they
usually conversed, with many odd silences, lapses <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>of logic
and incongruities of transition; like a pair who have grown old
together and learned to guess each other&rsquo;s sense; or, more
especially, like persons so conscious of a common point of view
that missing links and broken lights and loose ends, the
unexpressed and the understood, could do the office of talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really seem to be going out to sea,&rdquo; Percy
Beaumont observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my honour we&rsquo;re going
back to England.&nbsp; He has shipped us off again.&nbsp; I call
that &lsquo;real mean.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Lord
Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see those pretty girls at
Newport.&nbsp; You know he told us the place was an island, and
aren&rsquo;t all islands in the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the elder traveller after a while,
&ldquo;if his house is as good as his cigars I guess we shall
muddle through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy he&rsquo;s awfully &lsquo;prominent,&rsquo; you
know, and I rather liked him,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth pursued as if
this appreciation of Mr. Westgate had but just glimmered on
him.</p>
<p>His comrade, however, engaged in another thought, didn&rsquo;t
so much as appear to catch it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, I guess we had
better remain at the inn.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I like the
way he spoke of his house.&nbsp; I rather object to turning in
with such a tremendous lot of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.&nbsp;
And then they smoked a while in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy his
thinking we do no work in England!&rdquo; the young man
resumed.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t rouse his friend, who only replied:
&ldquo;I daresay he didn&rsquo;t really a bit think
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess they don&rsquo;t know much about England
over here!&rdquo; his lordship humorously sighed.&nbsp; After
which there was another long pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;He <i>has</i>
got us out of a hole,&rdquo; observed the young nobleman.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Percy
Beaumont genially assented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody certainly could
have been more civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Littledale said his wife was great fun,&rdquo; Lord
Lambeth then contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose wife&mdash;Littledale&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our benefactor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s his name?&nbsp; J. L.&nbsp; It &lsquo;kind of&rsquo;
sounds like a number.&nbsp; But I guess it&rsquo;s a high
number,&rdquo; he continued with freshened gaiety.</p>
<p>The same influences appeared, however, with Mr. Beaumont to
make rather for anxiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was fun to
Littledale,&rdquo; he said at last a little sententiously,
&ldquo;may be death to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; his companion
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as good a man as
Littledale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, I hope you won&rsquo;t begin to
flirt,&rdquo; said the elder man.</p>
<p>His friend smoked acutely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I daresay I
shan&rsquo;t <i>begin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a married woman, if she&rsquo;s bent upon it,
it&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; Mr. Beaumont allowed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But our friend mentioned a young lady&mdash;a sister, a
sister-in-law.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake keep free of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, &lsquo;free&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it she&rsquo;ll try to land you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh rot!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;American girls are very &lsquo;cute,&rsquo;&rdquo; the
other urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy they&rsquo;re always up to some wily
game,&rdquo; Mr. Beaumont developed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be worse than they are in
England,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but in England you&rsquo;ve got your natural
protectors.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got your mother and
sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and sisters&mdash;!&rdquo; the youth began
with a certain energy.&nbsp; But he stopped in time, puffing at
his cigar.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;Your mother spoke to me about it with tears in
her eyes,&rdquo; said his monitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;She said she felt
very nervous.&nbsp; I promised to keep you out of
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better take care of yourself!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Beaumont&rsquo;s charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the responsible party returned, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t the expectation of&mdash;whatever it is you
expect.&nbsp; Not to mention other attractions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry
out before you&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly very much cooler at Newport, where the
travellers found themselves assigned to a couple of diminutive
bedrooms in a far-away angle of an immense hotel.&nbsp; They had
gone ashore in the early summer twilight and had very promptly
put themselves to bed; thanks to which circumstance and to their
having, during the previous hours, in their commodious cabin,
slept the sleep of youth and health, they began to feel, towards
eleven o&rsquo;clock, very alert and inquisitive.&nbsp; They
looked out of their windows across a row of small green fields,
bordered with low stone dykes of rude construction, and saw a
deep blue ocean lying beneath a deep blue sky and flecked now and
then with scintillating patches of foam.&nbsp; A strong fresh
breeze came in through the curtainless apertures and prompted our
young men to observe generously that it didn&rsquo;t seem half a
bad climate.&nbsp; They made other observations after they had
emerged from their rooms in pursuit of breakfast&mdash;a meal of
which they partook in a huge bare hall where a hundred negroes in
white jackets shuffled about on an uncarpeted floor; where the
flies were superabundant and the tables and dishes covered over
with a strange voluminous integument of coarse blue gauze; and
where several little boys and girls, who had risen late, were
seated in fastidious solitude at the morning repast.&nbsp; These
young persons had not the morning <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>paper before them, but were engaged
in languid perusal of the bill of fare.</p>
<p>This latter document was a great puzzle to our friends, who,
on reflecting that its bewildering categories took account of
breakfast alone, had the uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic
dinner-list.&nbsp; They found copious diversion at their inn, an
enormous wooden structure for the erection of which it struck
them the virgin forests of the West must have been quite laid
waste.&nbsp; It was perforated from end to end with immense bare
corridors, through which a strong draught freely blew, bearing
along wonderful figures of ladies in white morning-dresses and
clouds of Valenciennes lace, who floated down the endless vistas
on expanded furbelows very much as angels spread their
wings.&nbsp; In front was a gigantic verandah on which an army
might have encamped&mdash;a vast wooden terrace with a roof as
high as the nave of a cathedral.&nbsp; Here our young men
enjoyed, as they supposed, a glimpse of American society, which
was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of
sedentary attitudes and appeared to consist largely of pretty
young girls, dressed as for a <i>f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</i>,
swaying to and fro in rocking-chairs, fanning themselves with
large straw fans and enjoying an enviable exemption from social
cares.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth had a theory, which it might be
interesting to trace to its origin, that it would be not only
agreeable, but easily possible, to enter into relations with one
of these young ladies; and his companion found occasion to check
his social yearning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better take care&mdash;else you&rsquo;ll have
an offended father or brother pulling out a
bowie-knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know the Americans come to these big
hotels to make acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about it, and neither do you,&rdquo; <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>said his
comrade, who, like a clever man, had begun to see that the
observation of American society demanded a readjustment of their
standard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, then, let&rsquo;s find out!&rdquo; he cried
with some impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t want to
miss anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>will</i> find out,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont
very reasonably.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see Mrs.
Westgate and make all the proper inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the inquiring pair, who had this lady&rsquo;s address
inscribed in her husband&rsquo;s hand on a card, descended from
the verandah of the big hotel and took their way, according to
direction, along a large straight road, past a series of
fresh-looking villas, embosomed in shrubs and flowers and
enclosed in an ingenious variety of wooden palings.&nbsp; The
morning shone and fluttered, the villas stood up bravely in their
smartness, and the walk of the young travellers turned all to
confidence.&nbsp; Everything looked as if it had received a coat
of fresh paint the day before&mdash;the red roofs, the green
shutters, the clean bright browns and buffs of the
house-fronts.&nbsp; The flower-beds on the little lawns sparkled
in the radiant air and the gravel in the short carriage-sweeps
flashed and twinkled.&nbsp; Along the road came a hundred little
basket-phaetons in which, almost always, a couple of ladies were
sitting&mdash;ladies in white dresses and long white gloves,
holding the reins and looking at the two Englishmen, whose
nationality was not elusive, through fine blue veils, tied
tightly about their faces as if to guard their complexions.&nbsp;
At last the visitors came within sight of the sea again, and
then, having interrogated a gardener over the paling of a villa,
turned into an open gate.&nbsp; Here they found themselves face
to face with the ocean and with a many-pointed much-balconied
structure, resembling a magnified chalet, perched on a green
embankment <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>just above it.&nbsp; The house had a verandah of
extraordinary width all round, and a great many doors and windows
standing open to the verandah.&nbsp; These various apertures had,
together, such an accessible hospitable air, such a breezy
flutter, within, of light curtains, such expansive thresholds and
reassuring interiors, that our friends hardly knew which was the
regular entrance and, after hesitating a moment, presented
themselves at one of the windows.&nbsp; The room within was
indistinct, but in a moment a graceful figure vaguely shaped
itself in the rich-looking gloom&mdash;a lady came to meet
them.&nbsp; Then they saw she had been seated at a table writing,
and that, hearing them, she had got up.&nbsp; She stepped out
into the light; she wore a frank charming smile, with which she
held out her hand to Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you must be Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heard from my husband that you were coming.&nbsp; I
make you warmly welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she shook hands with
each of her guests.&nbsp; Her guests were a little shy, but they
made a gallant effort; they responded with smiles and
exclamations, they apologised for not knowing the front
door.&nbsp; The lady returned with vivacity that when she wanted
to see people very much she didn&rsquo;t insist on those
distinctions, and that Mr. Westgate had written to her of his
English friends in terms that made her really anxious.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He says you&rsquo;re so terribly prostrated,&rdquo; she
reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you mean by the heat?&rdquo;&mdash;Percy Beaumont
rose to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were rather knocked up, but we feel
wonderfully better.&nbsp; We had such a
jolly&mdash;a&mdash;voyage down here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so very
good of you to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s so very kind of you,&rdquo; murmured
Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate stood smiling; Mrs. Westgate was pretty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I did mind, and I thought of sending <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>for you
this morning to the Ocean House.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very glad
you&rsquo;re better, and I&rsquo;m charmed you&rsquo;re really
with us.&nbsp; You must come round to the other side of the
piazza.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she led the way, with a light smooth
step, looking back at the young men and smiling.</p>
<p>The other side of the piazza was, as Lord Lambeth presently
remarked, a very jolly place.&nbsp; It was of the most liberal
proportions and, with its awnings, its fanciful chairs, its
cushions and rugs, its view of the ocean close at hand and
tumbling along the base of the low cliffs whose level tops
intervened in lawnlike smoothness, formed a charming complement
to the drawing-room.&nbsp; As such it was in course of employment
at the present hour; it was occupied by a social circle.&nbsp;
There were several ladies and two or three gentlemen, to whom
Mrs. Westgate proceeded to introduce the distinguished
strangers.&nbsp; She mentioned a great many names, very freely
and distinctly; the young Englishmen, shuffling about and bowing,
were rather bewildered.&nbsp; But at last they were provided with
chairs&mdash;low wicker chairs, gilded and tied with a great many
ribbons&mdash;and one of the ladies (a very young person with a
little snub nose and several dimples) offered Percy Beaumont a
fan.&nbsp; The fan was also adorned with pink love-knots, but the
more guarded of our couple declined it, though he was very
hot.&nbsp; Presently, however, everything turned to ease; the
breeze from the sea was delicious and the view charming; the
people sitting about looked fresh and fair.&nbsp; Several of the
younger ladies were clearly girls, and the gentlemen slim bright
youths such as our friends had seen the day before in New
York.&nbsp; The ladies were working on bands of tapestry, and one
of the young men had an open book in his lap.&nbsp; Percy
afterwards learned from a lady that this young man had been
reading aloud&mdash;that he was from Boston and was very fond of
reading aloud.&nbsp; <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Percy pronounced it a great pity
they had interrupted him; he should like so much (from all he had
heard) to listen to a Bostonian read.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t the
young man be induced to go on?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said this informant very freely;
&ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get the young ladies to
attend to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something very friendly, Beaumont saw, in the
attitude of the company; they looked at their new recruits with
an air of animated sympathy and interest; they smiled, brightly
and unanimously, at everything that dropped from either.&nbsp;
Lord Lambeth and his companion felt they were indeed made
cordially welcome.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate seated herself between
them, and while she talked continuously to each they had occasion
to observe that she came up to their friend Littledale&rsquo;s
promise.&nbsp; She was thirty years old, with the eyes and the
smile of a girl of seventeen, and was light and
graceful&mdash;elegant, exquisite.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate was,
further, what she had occasion to describe some person, among her
many winged words, as being, all spontaneity.&nbsp; Frank and
demonstrative, she appeared always&mdash;while she looked at you
delightedly with her beautiful young eyes&mdash;to be making
sudden confessions and concessions, breaking out after momentary
wonders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall expect to see a great deal of you,&rdquo; she
said to Lord Lambeth with her bland intensity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very fond of Englishmen here; that is, there
are a great many we&rsquo;ve been fond of.&nbsp; After a day or
two you must come and stay with us; we hope you&rsquo;ll stay a
nice long while.&nbsp; Newport&rsquo;s quite attractive when you
come really to know it, when you know plenty of people.&nbsp; Of
course you and Mr. Beaumont will have no difficulty about
that.&nbsp; Englishmen are very well received here; there are
almost always two or three of them about.&nbsp; I think they <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>always like
it, and I must say I should think they would.&nbsp; They receive
particular attention&mdash;I must say I think they sometimes get
spoiled; but I&rsquo;m sure you and Mr. Beaumont are proof
against that.&nbsp; My husband tells me you&rsquo;re friends of
Captain Littledale&rsquo;s; he was such a charming man.&nbsp; He
made himself so agreeable here that I wonder he didn&rsquo;t
stay.&nbsp; That would have carried out his system.&nbsp; It
couldn&rsquo;t have been pleasanter for him in his own
country.&nbsp; Though I suppose it&rsquo;s very pleasant in
England too&mdash;for English people.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
myself; I&rsquo;ve been there very little.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
a great deal abroad, but I always cling to the Continent.&nbsp; I
must say I&rsquo;m extremely fond of Paris; you know we Americans
always are; we go there when we die.&nbsp; Did you ever hear that
before?&mdash;it was said by a great wit.&nbsp; I mean the good
Americans; but we&rsquo;re all good&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see that
for yourself.&nbsp; All I know of England is London, and all I
know of London is that place&mdash;on that little corner, you
know&mdash;where you buy jackets, jackets with that coarse braid
and those big buttons.&nbsp; They make very good jackets in
London, I&rsquo;ll do you the justice to say that.&nbsp; And some
people like the hats.&nbsp; But about the hats I was always a
heretic; I always got my hats in Paris.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
wear an English hat&mdash;at least, I never could&mdash;unless
you dress your hair &agrave; l&rsquo;anglaise; and I must say
that&rsquo;s a talent I never possessed.&nbsp; In Paris
they&rsquo;ll make things to suit your peculiarities; but in
England I think you like much more to have&mdash;how shall I say
it?&mdash;one thing for everybody.&nbsp; I mean as regards
dress.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about other things; but
I&rsquo;ve always supposed that in other things everything was
different.&nbsp; I mean according to the people&mdash;according
to the classes and all that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
think I don&rsquo;t take a very favourable view; but you know you
can&rsquo;t take a very favourable view in Dover Street and the
<a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>month of
November.&nbsp; That has always been my fate.&nbsp; Do you know
Jones&rsquo;s Hotel in Dover Street?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I
know of England.&nbsp; Of course every one admits that the
English hotels are your weak point.&nbsp; There was always the
most frightful fog&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t see to try my things
on.&nbsp; When I got over to America&mdash;into the light&mdash;I
usually found they were twice too big.&nbsp; The next time I mean
to go at the right season; I guess I&rsquo;ll go next year.&nbsp;
I want very much to take my sister; she has never been to
England.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether you know what I mean by
saying that the Englishmen who come here sometimes get
spoiled.&nbsp; I mean they take things as a matter of
course&mdash;things that are done for them.&nbsp; Now naturally
anything&rsquo;s a matter of course only when the Englishmen are
very nice.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll say&mdash;oh yes you will, or
you would if some of you ever did say much!&mdash;they&rsquo;re
almost always very nice.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t expect this to be
nearly such an interesting country as England; there are not
nearly so many things to see, and we haven&rsquo;t your country
life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen anything of your country life;
when I&rsquo;m in Europe I&rsquo;m always on the Continent.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal about it; I know that when
you&rsquo;re among yourselves in the country you have the most
beautiful time.&nbsp; Of course we&rsquo;ve nothing of that sort,
we&rsquo;ve nothing on that scale.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t apologise,
Lord Lambeth; some Americans are always apologising; you must
have noticed that.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve the reputation of always
boasting and &lsquo;blowing&rsquo; and waving the American flag;
but I must say that what strikes me is that we&rsquo;re
perpetually making excuses and trying to smooth things
over.&nbsp; The American flag has quite gone out of fashion;
it&rsquo;s very carefully folded up, like a tablecloth the worse
for wear.&nbsp; Why should we apologise?&nbsp; The English never
apologise&mdash;do they?&nbsp; No, I must say I never
apologise.&nbsp; You must take us as we come&mdash;with <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>all our
imperfections on our heads.&nbsp; Of course we haven&rsquo;t your
country life and your old ruins and your great estates and your
leisure-class and all that&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t really know
anything about them, because when I go over I always cling to the
Continent.&nbsp; But if we haven&rsquo;t I should think you might
find it a pleasant change&mdash;I think any country&rsquo;s
pleasant where they have pleasant manners.&nbsp; Captain
Littledale told me he had never seen such pleasant manners as at
Newport, and he had been a great deal in European society.&nbsp;
Hadn&rsquo;t he been in the diplomatic service?&nbsp; He told me
the dream of his life was to get appointed to a diplomatic post
in Washington.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have
succeeded.&nbsp; Perhaps that was only a part of his pleasant
manners.&nbsp; I suppose at any rate that in England
promotion&mdash;and all that sort of thing&mdash;is fearfully
slow.&nbsp; With us, you know, it&rsquo;s a great deal too
quick.&nbsp; You see I admit our drawbacks.&nbsp; But I must
confess I think Newport an ideal place.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
anything like it anywhere.&nbsp; Captain Littledale told me he
didn&rsquo;t know anything like it anywhere.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
entirely different from most watering-places; it&rsquo;s a much
more refined life.&nbsp; I must say I think that when one goes to
a foreign country one ought to enjoy the differences.&nbsp; Of
course there are differences; otherwise what did one come abroad
for?&nbsp; Look for your pleasure in the differences, Lord
Lambeth; that&rsquo;s the way to do it; and then I am sure
you&rsquo;ll find American society&mdash;at least the Newport
phase quite unique.&nbsp; I wish very much Mr. Westgate were
here; but he&rsquo;s dreadfully confined to New York.&nbsp; I
suppose you think that&rsquo;s very strange&mdash;for a
gentleman.&nbsp; Only you see we haven&rsquo;t any
leisure-class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s discourse was delivered with a mild
merciless monotony, a paucity of intonation, an impartial
flatness that suggested a flowery mead <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>scrupulously &ldquo;done over&rdquo; by a steam roller
that had reduced its texture to that of a drawing-room
carpet.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth listened to her with, it must be
confessed, a rather ineffectual attention, though he summoned to
his aid such a show as he might of discriminating motions and
murmurs.&nbsp; He had no great faculty for apprehending
generalisations.&nbsp; There were some three or four indeed
which, in the play of his own intelligence, he had originated and
which had sometimes appeared to meet the case&mdash;any case; yet
he felt he had never known such a case as Mrs. Westgate or as her
presentation of her cases.&nbsp; But at the present time he could
hardly have been said to follow this exponent as she darted
fish-like through the sea of speculation.&nbsp; Fortunately she
asked for no special rejoinder, since she looked about at the
rest of the company as well and smiled at Mr. Beaumont on the
other side of her as if he too must understand her and agree with
her.&nbsp; He was measurably more successful than his companion;
for besides being, as we know, cleverer, his attention was not
vaguely distracted by close vicinity to a remarkably interesting
young person with dark hair and blue eyes.&nbsp; This was the
situation of Lord Lambeth, to whom it occurred after a while that
the young person with blue eyes and dark hair might be the pretty
sister of whom Mrs. Westgate had spoken.&nbsp; She presently
turned to him with a remark establishing her identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity you couldn&rsquo;t have brought
my brother-in-law with you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great shame he
should be in New York on such days as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s very stuffy,&rdquo; said Lord
Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be dreadful there,&rdquo; said the pretty
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he&rsquo;s immensely taken up,&rdquo; the
young man returned with a sense of conscientiously yearning
toward American realities.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;The gentlemen in America work too much,&rdquo;
his friend went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh do they?&nbsp; Well, I daresay they like it,&rdquo;
he hopefully threw out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; One never sees
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you really?&rdquo; asked Lord
Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have fancied
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come to study American manners?&rdquo; the
blue eyes and dark hair went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I just came over for the
joke of it.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t got long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
occurred a pause, after which he began again.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he
will turn up here, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope he will.&nbsp; He must help to
entertain you and Mr. Beaumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth looked at her from handsome eyes that were
brown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose he&rsquo;d have come down with
us if we had pressed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pretty girl treated this as rather an easy
conundrum.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay he would,&rdquo; she
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said the young Englishman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, he was no end civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His young woman seemed much amused; this at least was in her
eyes, which freely met Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
would be.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a perfect husband.&nbsp; But all
Americans are that,&rdquo; she confidently continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Lord Lambeth exclaimed again; and
wondered whether all American ladies had such a passion for
generalising as these two.</p>
<h3><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>III</h3>
<p>He sat there a good while: there was a great deal of talk; it
was all pitched in a key of expression and emphasis rather new to
him.&nbsp; Every one present, the cool maidens not least,
personally addressed him, and seemed to make a particular point
of doing so by the friendly repetition of his name.&nbsp; Three
or four other persons came in, and there was a shifting of seats,
a changing of places; the gentlemen took, individually, an
interest in the visitors, putting somehow more imagination and
more &ldquo;high comedy&rdquo; into this effort than the latter
had ever seen displayed save in a play or a story.&nbsp; These
well-wishers feared the two Britons mightn&rsquo;t be comfortable
at their hotel&mdash;it being, as one of them said, &ldquo;not so
private as those dear little English inns of yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This last gentleman added that as yet perhaps, alas, privacy
wasn&rsquo;t quite so easily obtained in America as might be
desired; still, he continued, you could generally get it by
paying for it; in fact you could get everything in America
nowadays by paying for it.&nbsp; The life was really growing more
private; it was growing greatly to resemble European&mdash;which
wasn&rsquo;t to be wondered at when two-thirds of the people
leading it were so awfully much at home in Europe.&nbsp; Europe,
in the course of this conversation, was indeed, as Lord Lambeth
afterwards remarked to his compatriot, rather bewilderingly
rubbed into them: did they <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>pretend to be European, and when had
they ever been entered under that head?&nbsp; Everything at
Newport, at all events, was described to them as thoroughly
private; they would probably find themselves, when all was said,
a good deal struck with that.&nbsp; It was also represented to
the strangers that it mattered very little whether their hotel
was agreeable, as every one would want them to &ldquo;visit
round,&rdquo; as somebody called it: they would stay with other
people and in any case would be constantly at Mrs.
Westgate&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They would find that charming; it was the
pleasantest house in Newport.&nbsp; It was only a pity Mr.
Westgate was never there&mdash;he being a tremendously fine man,
one of the finest they had.&nbsp; He worked like a horse and left
his wife to play the social part.&nbsp; Well, she played it all
right, if that was all he wanted.&nbsp; He liked her to enjoy
herself, and she did know how.&nbsp; She was highly cultivated
and a splendid converser&mdash;the sort of converser people would
come miles to hear.&nbsp; But some preferred her sister, who was
in a different style altogether.&nbsp; Some even thought her
prettier, but decidedly Miss Alden wasn&rsquo;t so smart.&nbsp;
She was more in the Boston style&mdash;the quiet Boston; she had
lived a great deal there and was very highly educated.&nbsp;
Boston girls, it was intimated, were more on the English
model.</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth had presently a chance to test the truth of this
last proposition; for, the company rising in compliance with a
suggestion from their hostess that they should walk down to the
rocks and look at the sea, the young Englishman again found
himself, as they strolled across the grass, in proximity to Mrs.
Westgate&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; Though Miss Alden was but a girl
of twenty she appeared conscious of the weight of
expectation&mdash;unless she quite wantonly took on duties she
might have let alone; and this was perhaps the more to be noticed
as she seemed by habit rather <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>grave and backward, perhaps even
proud, with little of the other&rsquo;s free fraternising.&nbsp;
She might have been thought too deadly thin, not to say also too
deadly pale; but while she moved over the grass, her arms hanging
at her sides, and, seriously or absently, forgot expectations,
though again brightly to remember them and to look at the summer
sea, as if that was what she really cared for, her companion
judged her at least as pretty as Mrs. Westgate and reflected that
if this was the Boston style, &ldquo;the quiet Boston,&rdquo; it
would do very well.&nbsp; He could fancy her very clever, highly
educated and all the rest of it; but clearly also there were ways
in which she could spare a fellow&mdash;could ease him; she
wouldn&rsquo;t keep him so long on the stretch at once.&nbsp; For
all her cleverness, moreover, he felt she had to think a little
what to say; she didn&rsquo;t say the first thing that came into
her head: he had come from a different part of the world, from a
different society, and she was trying to adapt her
conversation.&nbsp; The others were scattered about the rocks;
Mrs. Westgate had charge of Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very jolly place for this sort of thing,&rdquo; Lord
Lambeth said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must do beautifully to
sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does indeed; there are cosy nooks and there are
breezy ones, which I often try&mdash;as if they had been made on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I suppose you&rsquo;ve had a lot made,&rdquo; he
fell in.</p>
<p>She seemed to wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no, we&rsquo;ve had
nothing made.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all pure nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d have a few little
benches&mdash;rustic seats and that sort of thing.&nbsp; It might
really be so jolly to &lsquo;develop&rsquo; the place,&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>
<p>It made her thoughtful&mdash;even a little rueful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we haven&rsquo;t so many of those things
as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, if you go in for pure nature, as you were
saying, there&rsquo;s nothing like that.&nbsp; Nature, over here,
<a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>must be
awfully grand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lord Lambeth looked about
him.</p>
<p>The little coast-line that contributed to the view melted
away, but it too much lacked presence and character&mdash;a fact
Miss Alden appeared to rise to a perception of.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it seems to you very rough.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not like the coast-scenery in Kingsley&rsquo;s
novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t let her, however, undervalue it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, the novels always overdo everything, you know.&nbsp;
You mustn&rsquo;t go by the novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wandered a little on the rocks; they stopped to look into
a narrow chasm where the rising tide made a curious bellowing
sound.&nbsp; It was loud enough to prevent their hearing each
other, and they stood for some moments in silence.&nbsp; The
girl&rsquo;s eyes took in her companion, observing him
attentively but covertly, as those of women even in blinking
youth know how to do.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth repaid contemplation;
tall straight and strong, he was handsome as certain young
Englishmen, and certain young Englishmen almost alone, are
handsome; with a perfect finish of feature and a visible repose
of mind, an inaccessibility to questions, somehow stamped in by
the same strong die and pressure that nature, designing a
precious medal, had selected and applied.&nbsp; It was not that
he looked stupid; it was only, we assume, that his perceptions
didn&rsquo;t show in his face for restless or his imagination for
irritable.&nbsp; He was not, as he would himself have said,
tremendously clever; but, though there was rather a constant
appeal for delay in his waiting, his perfectly patient eye, this
registered simplicity had its beauty as well and, whatever it
might have appeared to plead for, didn&rsquo;t plead in the name
of indifference or inaction.&nbsp; This most searching of his new
friends thought him the handsomest young man she had ever seen;
and Bessie Alden&rsquo;s <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>imagination, unlike that of her
companion, was irritable.&nbsp; He, however, had already made up
his mind, quite originally and without aid, that she had a grace
exceedingly her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s very gay here&mdash;that
you&rsquo;ve lots of balls and parties,&rdquo; he said; since,
though not tremendously clever, he rather prided himself on
having with women a strict sufficiency of conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, there&rsquo;s a great deal going on.&nbsp;
There are not so many balls, but there are a good many other
pleasant things,&rdquo; Bessie Alden explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself; we live rather in the midst
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very kind of you to let us see.&nbsp; But I
thought you Americans were always dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we dance a good deal, though I&rsquo;ve never
seen much of it.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t do it much, at any rate in
summer.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we
haven&rsquo;t as many balls as you in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered&mdash;these so many prompt assumptions about his
own country made him gape a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, in England
it all depends, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not think much of our gaieties,&rdquo; she
said&mdash;though she seemed to settle it for him with a quaver
of interrogation.&nbsp; The interrogation sounded earnest indeed
and the decision arch; the mixture, at any rate, was
charming.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those things with us are much less
splendid than in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy you don&rsquo;t really mean that,&rdquo; her
companion laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I really mean everything I say,&rdquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly from what I&rsquo;ve read about
English society it is very different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, you know,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, who
appeared to cling to this general theory, &ldquo;those things are
often described by fellows who know nothing about them.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t mind what you read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what a blasphemous speech&mdash;I <i>must</i> mind
<a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>what I
read!&rdquo; our young woman protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I read
Thackeray and George Eliot how can I help minding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, Thackeray and George Eliot&rdquo;&mdash;and
her friend pleasantly bethought himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I haven&rsquo;t read much of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose they knew about society?&rdquo;
asked Bessie Alden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I daresay they knew; they must have got up their
subject.&nbsp; Good writers do, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But those
fashionable novels are mostly awful rot, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion rested on him a moment her dark blue eyes; after
which she looked down into the chasm where the water was tumbling
about.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean Catherine Grace Gore, for
instance?&rdquo; she then more aspiringly asked.</p>
<p>But at this he broke down&mdash;he coloured, laughed, gave
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t read that
either.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m not
very intellectual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading Mrs. Gore is no proof of intellect.&nbsp; But I
like reading everything about English life&mdash;even poor
books.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so curious about it,&rdquo; said Bessie
Alden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t ladies curious about everything?&rdquo; he
asked with continued hilarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
we&rsquo;re enough so&mdash;that we care about many things.&nbsp;
So it&rsquo;s all the more of a compliment,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;that I should want to know so much about
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The logic here seemed a little close; but Lord Lambeth,
advised of a compliment, found his natural modesty close at
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know a great deal more than
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think I know a great deal&mdash;for a person
who has never been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you really never been there?&rdquo; cried
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;Never&mdash;except in imagination.&nbsp; And I
<i>have</i> been to Paris,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; he repeated with
gaiety&mdash;&ldquo;fancy taking those brutes first!&nbsp; But
you <i>will</i> come soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dream of my life!&rdquo; Bessie Alden
brightly professed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister at any rate seems to know a tremendous lot
about us,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth went on.</p>
<p>She appeared to take her view of this.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister
and I are two very different persons.&nbsp; She has been a great
deal in Europe.&nbsp; She has been in England a little&mdash;not
intimately.&nbsp; But she has met English people in other
countries, and she arrives very quickly at
conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I guess she does,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you must have known some too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to
one before.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the first Englishman that&mdash;to
my knowledge&mdash;I&rsquo;ve ever talked with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie Alden made this statement with a certain
gravity&mdash;almost, as it seemed to the young man, an
impressiveness.&nbsp; The impressive always made him feel
awkward, and he now began to laugh and swing his stick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;d have been sure to know!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then he added after an instant: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m
not a better specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked away, but taking it more gaily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must remember you&rsquo;re only a
beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she retraced her steps, leading the
way back to the lawn, where they saw Mrs. Westgate come toward
them with Percy Beaumont still at her side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
I shall go to England next year,&rdquo; Miss Alden continued;
&ldquo;I want to immensely.&nbsp; My sister expects to cross
about then, and she has asked me to go with her.&nbsp; If I do I
shall make her stay as long as possible in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you must come early in July,&rdquo; said Lord <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time when
there&rsquo;s most going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can wait even till early in
July,&rdquo; his friend returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the first of
May I shall be very impatient.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had gone
further, and Mrs. Westgate and her companion were near.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said the younger sister, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
given out that we go to London next May.&nbsp; So please to
conduct yourself accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Beaumont wore a somewhat animated&mdash;even a slightly
irritated&mdash;air.&nbsp; He was by no means of so handsome an
effect as his comrade, though in the latter&rsquo;s absence he
might, with his manly stature and his fair dense beard, his fresh
clean skin and his quiet outlook, have pleased by a due
affirmation of the best British points.&nbsp; Just now
Beaumont&rsquo;s clear eyes had a rather troubled light, which,
after glancing at Bessie Alden while she spoke, he turned with
some intensity on Lord Lambeth.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s
beautiful radiance of interest and dissent fell meanwhile
impartially everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better wait till the time comes,&rdquo; she
said to her sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps next May you won&rsquo;t
care so much for London.&nbsp; Mr. Beaumont and I,&rdquo; she
went on, smiling at her companion, &ldquo;have had a tremendous
discussion.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t agree about anything.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s perfectly delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say, Percy!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disagree,&rdquo; said Beaumont, raising his eyebrows
and stroking down his back hair, &ldquo;even to the point of
thinking it <i>not</i> delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you <i>must</i> have been getting it!&rdquo; cried
his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything delightful in my disagreeing
with Mrs. Westgate,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate declared as she turned
again to her sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;ve to go <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>to
town.&nbsp; There must be something at the door for you.&nbsp;
You had better take Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaumont, at this point, looked straight at his comrade,
trying to catch his eye.&nbsp; But Lord Lambeth wouldn&rsquo;t
look at him; his own eyes were better occupied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall be very happy&rdquo;&mdash;Bessie Alden rose straight to
their hostess&rsquo;s suggestion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
going to some shops.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll drive you about and
show you the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American woman who respects herself,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Westgate, turning to the elder man with her bright
expository air, &ldquo;must buy something every day of her
life.&nbsp; If she can&rsquo;t do it herself she must send out
some member of her family for the purpose.&nbsp; So Bessie goes
forth to fulfil my mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had walked away with Lord Lambeth by her side, to
whom she was talking still; and Percy Beaumont watched them as
they passed toward the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;She fulfils her own
mission,&rdquo; he presently said; &ldquo;that of being very
attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even here Mrs. Westgate discriminated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I should precisely say attractive.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s not so much that as she&rsquo;s charming when you
really know her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh indeed?&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont with evident
wonder.&nbsp; And then as if to alternate with a certain grace
the note of scepticism: &ldquo;I guess your shyness, in that
case, is different from ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything of ours is different from yours,&rdquo; Mrs.
Westgate instantly returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my poor
sister&rsquo;s given over, I hold, to a fine Boston
<i>gaucherie</i> that has rubbed off on her by being there so
much.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear good girl, however; she&rsquo;s a
charming type of girl.&nbsp; She is not in the least a flirt;
that isn&rsquo;t at all her line; she doesn&rsquo;t know the
alphabet of any such vulgarity.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very simple,
very serious, very <i>true</i>.&nbsp; She has lived, however,
rather too much in Boston <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>with another sister of mine, the
eldest of us, who married a Bostonian.&nbsp; Bessie&rsquo;s very
cultivated, not at all like me&mdash;I&rsquo;m not in the least
cultivated and am called so only by those who don&rsquo;t know
what true culture is.&nbsp; But Bessie does; she has studied
Greek; she has read everything; she&rsquo;s what they call in
Boston &lsquo;thoughtful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, it only depends on what one thinks
<i>about</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaumont, who appeared to find her
zeal for distinctions catching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate pursued,
&ldquo;that the most charming girl in the world is a Boston
superstructure on a New York <i>fond</i>, or perhaps a New York
superstructure on a Boston <i>fond</i>.&nbsp; At any rate
it&rsquo;s the mixture,&rdquo; she declared, continuing to supply
her guest with information and to do him the honours of the
American world with a zeal that left nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth got into a light low pony-cart with Bessie Alden,
and she drove him down the long Avenue, whose extent he had
measured on foot a couple of hours before, into the ancient town,
as it was called in that part of the world, of Newport.&nbsp; The
ancient town was a curious affair&mdash;a collection of
fresh-looking little wooden houses, painted white, scattered over
a hill-side and clustering about a long straight street paved
with huge old cobbles.&nbsp; There were plenty of shops, a large
allowance of which appeared those of fruit-vendors, with piles of
huge water-melons and pumpkins stacked in front of them; while,
drawn up before the shops or bumping about on the round stones,
were innumerable other like or different carts freighted with
ladies of high fashion who greeted each other from vehicle to
vehicle and conversed on the edge of the pavement in a manner
that struck Lord Lambeth as of the last effusiveness: with a
great many &ldquo;Oh my dears&rdquo; and little quick sounds and
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>motions&mdash;obscure native words, shibboleths and
signs.&nbsp; His companion went into seventeen shops&mdash;he
amused himself with counting them&mdash;and accumulated at the
bottom of the trap a pile of bundles that hardly left the young
Englishman a place for his feet.&nbsp; As she had no other
attendant he sat in the phaeton to hold the pony; where, though
not a particularly acute observer, he saw much harmlessly to
divert him&mdash;especially the ladies just mentioned, who
wandered up and down with an aimless intentness, as if looking
for something to buy, and who, tripping in and out of their
vehicles, displayed remarkably pretty feet.&nbsp; It all seemed
to Lord Lambeth very odd and bright and gay.&nbsp; And he felt by
the time they got back to the villa that he had made a stride in
intimacy with Miss Alden.</p>
<p>The young Englishmen spent the whole of that day and the whole
of many successive days in the cultivation, right and left, far
and near, of this celerity of social progress.&nbsp; They agreed
that it was all extremely jolly&mdash;that they had never known
anything more agreeable.&nbsp; It is not proposed to report the
detail of their sojourn on this charming shore; though were it
convenient I might present a record of impressions none the less
soothing that they were not exhaustively analysed.&nbsp; Many of
them still linger in the minds of our travellers, attended by a
train of harmonious images&mdash;images of early breezy shining
hours on lawns and piazzas that overlooked the sea; of
innumerable pretty girls saying innumerable quaint and familiar
things; of infinite lounging and talking and laughing and
flirting and lunching and dining; of a confidence that broke
down, of a freedom that pulled up, nowhere; of an idyllic ease
that was somehow too ordered for a primitive social consciousness
and too innocent for a developed; of occasions on which they so
knew every one and everything that they almost <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>ached with
reciprocity; of drives and rides in the late afternoon, over
gleaming beaches, on long sea-roads, beneath a sky lighted up by
marvellous sunsets; of tea-tables, on the return, informal,
irregular, agreeable; of evenings at open windows or on the
perpetual verandahs, in the summer starlight, above the warm
Atlantic and amid irrelevant outbursts of clever
minstrelsy.&nbsp; The young Englishmen were introduced to
everybody, entertained by everybody, intimate with everybody, and
it was all the book of life, of American life, at least; with the
chapter of &ldquo;complications&rdquo; bodily omitted.&nbsp; At
the end of three days they had removed their luggage from the
hotel and had gone to stay with Mrs. Westgate&mdash;a step as to
which Percy Beaumont at first took up an attitude of mistrust
apparently founded on some odd and just a little barbaric talk
forced on him, he would have been tempted to say, and very soon
after their advent, by Miss Alden.&nbsp; He had indeed been aware
of her occasional approach or appeal, since she wasn&rsquo;t
literally always in conversation with Lord Lambeth.&nbsp; He had
meditated on Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s account of her sister and
discovered for himself that the young lady was
&ldquo;sharp&rdquo; (Percy&rsquo;s critical categories remained
few and simple) and appeared to have read a great deal.&nbsp; She
seemed perfectly well-bred, though he couldn&rsquo;t make out
that, as Mrs. Westgate funnily insisted, she was shy.&nbsp; If
she was shy she carried it off with an ease&mdash;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Beaumont,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;please tell
me something about Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; How would
you say it in England?&mdash;his position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His position?&rdquo;&nbsp; Percy&rsquo;s instinct was
to speak as if he had never heard of such a matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His rank&mdash;or whatever you call it.&nbsp;
Unfortunately we haven&rsquo;t got a &lsquo;Peerage,&rsquo; like
the people in Thackeray.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great pity,&rdquo; Percy
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d find the whole matter in black
and white, and upon my honour I know very little about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl seemed to wonder at this innocence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know at least whether he&rsquo;s what they call a great
noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he&rsquo;s in that line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a &lsquo;peer of the realm&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as yet&mdash;very nearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he any other title than Lord
Lambeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His title&rsquo;s the Marquis of Lambeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With which the fountain of Bessie&rsquo;s information appeared to
run a little dry.&nbsp; She looked at him, however, with such
interest that he presently added: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the son of
the Duke of Bayswater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eldest&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are his parents living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally&mdash;as to his father.&nbsp; If <i>he</i>
weren&rsquo;t living Lambeth would be a duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that when &lsquo;the old lord&rsquo;
dies&rdquo;&mdash;and the girl smiled with more simplicity than
might have been expected in one so
&ldquo;sharp&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll become Duke of
Bayswater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said their common friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But his father&rsquo;s in excellent health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy seemed amused.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Duchess is built to
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he any sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them&rsquo;s married.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the
Countess of Pimlico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other&rsquo;s unmarried&mdash;she&rsquo;s plain
Lady Julia.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>Bessie entered into it all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she very
plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to laugh again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t find
her so handsome as her brother,&rdquo; he said; and it was after
this that he attempted to dissuade the heir of the Duke of
Bayswater from accepting Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that girl means to
have a go at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you&rsquo;re doing your best to make a
fool of me,&rdquo; the modest young nobleman answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been asking me,&rdquo; his friend imperturbably
pursued, &ldquo;all about your people and your
possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very good of her!&rdquo; Lord
Lambeth returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Percy, &ldquo;if you go
straight into it, if you hurl yourself bang upon the spears, you
do so with your eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn my eyes!&rdquo; the young man pronounced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If one&rsquo;s to be a dozen times a day at the house
it&rsquo;s a great deal more convenient to sleep there.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sick of travelling up and down this beastly
Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since he had determined to go Percy would of course have been
very sorry to allow him to go alone; he was a man of many
scruples&mdash;in the direction in which he had any at
all&mdash;and he remembered his promise to the Duchess.&nbsp; It
was obviously the memory of this promise that made Mr. Beaumont
say to his companion a couple of days later that he rather
wondered he should be so fond of such a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place how do you know how fond I
am?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;And in the second why
shouldn&rsquo;t I be fond of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d be in your
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call my &lsquo;line&rsquo;?&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t set her down, I suppose, as
&lsquo;fast&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate tells me that
there&rsquo;s no such thing as the fast girl in America; that
it&rsquo;s <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>an English invention altogether and that the term has
no meaning here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an animal I
detest,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You prefer, then, rather a priggish American
<i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth took his time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you call Miss
Alden all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her sister tells me,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont,
&ldquo;that she&rsquo;s tremendously literary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t she be?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
certainly very clever and has every appearance of a well-stored
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy for an instant watched his young friend, who had turned
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should rather have supposed you&rsquo;d find
her stores oppressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, after this, faced him again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
do you think me such a dunce?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as his friend
but vaguely protested: &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
he said&mdash;and quite as if this judgement covered all the
ground.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that there was no ground&mdash;but
he knew what he was about.</p>
<p>Percy, for a while further, and a little uncomfortably flushed
with the sense of his false position&mdash;that of presenting
culture in a &ldquo;mean&rdquo; light, as they said at
Newport&mdash;Percy kept his peace; but on August 10th he wrote
to the Duchess of Bayswater.&nbsp; His conception of certain
special duties and decencies, as I have said, was strong, and
this step wholly fell in with it.&nbsp; His companion meanwhile
was having much talk with Miss Alden&mdash;on the red sea-rocks
beyond the lawn; in the course of long island rides, with a slow
return in the glowing twilight; on the deep verandah, late in the
evening.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth, who had stayed at many houses, had
never stayed at one in which it was possible for a young man to
converse so freely and frequently with a young lady.&nbsp; This
<a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>young
lady no longer applied to their other guest for information
concerning his lordship.&nbsp; She addressed herself directly to
the young nobleman.&nbsp; She asked him a great many questions,
some of which did, according to Mr. Beaumont&rsquo;s term, a
little oppress him; for he took no pleasure in talking about
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lambeth&rdquo;&mdash;this had been one of
them&mdash;&ldquo;are you an hereditary legislator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make
me call myself such names as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re natural members of
Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your father sit in the House of
Lords?&rdquo; Bessie Alden went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very seldom,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a very august position?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it would be very grand&rdquo;&mdash;she
serenely kept it up, as the female American, he judged, would
always keep anything up&mdash;&ldquo;to possess simply by an
accident of birth the right to make laws for a great
nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but one doesn&rsquo;t make laws.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a lot of humbug about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; the girl
unconfusedly declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be a great privilege,
and I should think that if one thought of it in the right
way&mdash;from a high point of view&mdash;it would be very
inspiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less one thinks of it the better, I guess!&rdquo;
Lord Lambeth after a moment returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s tremendous&rdquo;&mdash;this at
least she kept up; and on another occasion she asked him if he
had any tenantry.&nbsp; Hereupon it was that, as I have said, he
felt a little the burden of her earnestness.</p>
<p>But he took it good-humouredly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want to
buy up their leases?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;Well&mdash;have you got any
&lsquo;livings&rsquo;?&rdquo; she demanded as if the word were
rich and rare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have <i>you</i>
got a pet clergyman looking out?&rdquo;&nbsp; But she made him
plead guilty to his having, in prospect, a castle; he confessed
to but one.&nbsp; It was the place in which he had been born and
brought up, and, as he had an old-time liking for it, he was
beguiled into a few pleasant facts about it and into pronouncing
it really very jolly.&nbsp; Bessie listened with great interest,
declaring she would give the world to see such a place.&nbsp; To
which he charmingly made answer: &ldquo;It would be awfully kind
of you to come and stay there, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not
inconvenient to him meanwhile that Percy Beaumont hadn&rsquo;t
happened to hear him make this genial remark.</p>
<p>Mr. Westgate, all this time, hadn&rsquo;t, as they said at
Newport, &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife more than once
announced that she expected him on the morrow; but on the morrow
she wandered about a little, with a telegram in her jewelled
fingers, pronouncing it too &ldquo;fiendish&rdquo; he should let
his business so dreadfully absorb him that he could but
platonically hope, as she expressed it, his two Englishmen were
having a good time.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s no thanks to him if you
are!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she went on to explain, while she kept up
that slow-paced circulation which enabled her well-adjusted
skirts to display themselves so advantageously, that
unfortunately in America there was no leisure-class and that the
universal passionate surrender of the men to business-questions
and business-questions only, as if they were the all in all of
life, was a tide that would have to be stemmed.&nbsp; It was Lord
Lambeth&rsquo;s theory, freely propounded when the young men were
together, that Percy was having a very good time with Mrs.
Westgate and that under the pretext of meeting for the purpose of
animated discussion they were <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>indulging in practices that imparted
a shade of hypocrisy to the lady&rsquo;s regret for her
husband&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you we&rsquo;re always discussing and
differing,&rdquo; Mr. Beaumont however asseverated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awfully argumentative.&nbsp; American ladies
certainly don&rsquo;t mind contradicting you flat.&nbsp; Upon my
word I don&rsquo;t think I was ever treated so by a woman
before.&nbsp; We have ours ever so much more in hand.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s so devilish positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superlative degree so variously affirmed, however, was
evidently a source of attraction in Mrs. Westgate, for the elder
man was constantly at his hostess&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He detached
himself one day to the extent of going to New York to talk over
the Tennessee Central with her husband; but he was absent only
forty-eight hours, during which, with that gentleman&rsquo;s
assistance, he completely settled this piece of business.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They know how to put things&mdash;and put
people&mdash;&lsquo;through&rsquo; in New York,&rdquo; he
subsequently and quite breathlessly observed to his comrade; and
he added that Mr. Westgate had seemed markedly to fear his wife
might suffer for loss of her guest&mdash;he had been in such an
awful hurry to send him back to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ll never come up to an American husband&mdash;if
that&rsquo;s what the wives expect,&rdquo; he said to Lord
Lambeth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate, however, was not to enjoy much longer the
entertainment with which an indulgent husband had desired to keep
her provided.&nbsp; August had still a part of its course to run
when his lordship received from his mother the disconcerting news
that his father had been taken ill and that he had best at once
come home.&nbsp; The young nobleman concealed his chagrin with no
great success.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left the Duke but the other day
absolutely all right&mdash;so what the deuce does it mean?&rdquo;
he asked of his comrade.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a fellow to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>Percy
Beaumont was scarce less annoyed; he had deemed it his duty, as
we know, to report faithfully to the Duchess, but had not
expected this distinguished woman to act so promptly on his
hint.&nbsp; &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your
father is somehow, and rather suddenly, laid up.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s anything serious, but you&rsquo;ve
no option.&nbsp; Take the first steamer, but take it without
alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This really struck Lord Lambeth as meaning that he essentially
needn&rsquo;t take it, since alarm would have been his only good
motive; yet he nevertheless, after an hour of intenser irritation
than he could quite have explained to himself, made his
farewells; in the course of which he exchanged a few last words
with Bessie Alden that are the only ones making good their place
in our record.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I needn&rsquo;t assure you
that if you should come to England next year I expect to be the
very first person notified of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in that way she had which never quite struck
him as straight and clear, yet which always struck him as kind
and true.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if we come to London I should think
you&rsquo;d sufficiently hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Beaumont felt it his duty also to embark, and this same
rigour compelled him, one windless afternoon, in mid-Atlantic, to
say to his friend that he suspected the Duchess&rsquo;s telegram
to have been in part the result of something he himself had
written her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wrote her&mdash;as I distinctly
warned you I had promised in general to do&mdash;that you were
extremely interested in a little American girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, much upset by this avowal, indulged for some
moments in the strong and simple language of resentment.&nbsp;
But if I have described him as inclined to candour and to reason
I can give no better proof of it than the fact of his being ready
to face the truth by the end of half an hour.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
were <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>quite right after all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very much
interested in her.&nbsp; Only, to be fair,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;you should have told my mother also that she&rsquo;s
not&mdash;at all seriously&mdash;interested in poor
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaumont gave the rein to mirth and mockery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so charming as modesty in a young
man in the position of &lsquo;poor&rsquo; you.&nbsp; That speech
settles for me the question of what&rsquo;s the matter with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s handsome eyes turned rueful and
queer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is anything so flagrantly the matter with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything, my dear boy,&rdquo; laughed his companion,
passing a hand into his arm for a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>she</i> isn&rsquo;t interested&mdash;she
isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the young man insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont rather
gravely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very far gone!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>IV</h3>
<p>In point of fact, as the latter would have said, Mrs. Westgate
disembarked by the next mid-May on the British coast.&nbsp; She
was accompanied by her sister, but unattended by any other member
of her family.&nbsp; To the lost comfort of a husband respectably
to produce, as she phrased it, she was now habituated; she had
made half a dozen journeys to Europe under this drawback of
looking ill-temperedly separated and yet of being thanklessly
enslaved, and she still decently accounted for her spurious
singleness to wondering friends on this side of the Atlantic by
formulating the grim truth&mdash;the only grimness indeed in all
her view&mdash;that in America there is no leisure-class.&nbsp;
The two ladies came up to London and alighted at Jones&rsquo;s
Hotel, where Mrs. Westgate, who had made on former occasions the
most agreeable impression at this establishment, received an
obsequious greeting.&nbsp; Bessie Alden had felt much excited
about coming to England; she had expected the
&ldquo;associations&rdquo; would carry her away and counted on
the joy of treating her eyes and her imagination to all the
things she had read of in poets and historians.&nbsp; She was
very fond of the poets and historians, of the picturesque, of the
past, of associations, of relics and reverberations of greatness;
so that on coming into the great English world, where strangeness
and familiarity would go hand in hand, she was prepared for a
swarm of fresh emotions.&nbsp; They began very <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>promptly&mdash;these tender fluttering sensations; they
began with the sight of the beautiful English landscape, whose
dark richness was quickened and brightened by the season; with
the carpeted fields and flowering hedge-rows, as she looked at
them from the window of the train; with the spires of the rural
churches peeping above the rook-haunted tree-tops; with the
oak-studded, deer-peopled parks, the ancient homes, the cloudy
light, the speech, the manners, all the significant
differences.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s response was of course
less quick and less extravagant, and she gave but a wandering
attention to her sister&rsquo;s ejaculations and rhapsodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my enjoyment of England&rsquo;s not so
intellectual as Bessie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said to several of her
friends in the course of her visit to this country.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And yet if it&rsquo;s not intellectual I can&rsquo;t say
it&rsquo;s in the least sensual.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I can
quite say what it is, my enjoyment of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
once it was settled that the two ladies should come abroad and
should spend a few weeks in London and perhaps in other parts of
the celebrated island on their way to the Continent, they of
course exchanged a good many allusions to their English
acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will certainly be much nicer having friends
there,&rdquo; was a remark that had one day dropped from Bessie
while she sat on the sunny deck of the steamer, at her
sister&rsquo;s feet, from under which spread conveniently a large
soft rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean by friends?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate had
then invited the girl to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those English gentlemen you&rsquo;ve known and
entertained.&nbsp; Captain Littledale, for instance.&nbsp; And
Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont,&rdquo; the girl further
mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect them to give us a very grand
reception?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>She
reflected a moment; she was addicted, as we know, to fine
reflexion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&mdash;to be nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor sweet child!&rdquo; murmured her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I said that&rsquo;s so silly?&rdquo; Bessie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little too simple; just a little.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very becoming, but it pleases people at your
expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly too simple to understand
you,&rdquo; said our young lady.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate had an ominous pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I tell
you a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d be so good.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s frequently done to amuse simple people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate consulted her memory while her companion sat at
gaze of the shining sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the
Duke of Green-Erin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no matter,&rdquo; her sister went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proof of my simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My story&rsquo;s meant to illustrate that of some other
people,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Duke of
Green-Erin&rsquo;s what they call in England a great swell, and
some five years ago he came to America.&nbsp; He spent most of
his time in New York, and in New York he spent his days and his
nights at the Butterworths&rsquo;.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard at
least of the Butterworths.&nbsp; <i>Bien</i>.&nbsp; They did
everything in the world for him&mdash;the poor
Butterworths&mdash;they turned themselves inside out.&nbsp; They
gave him a dozen dinner-parties and balls, and were the means of
his being invited to fifty more.&nbsp; At first he used to come
into Mrs. Butterworth&rsquo;s box at the opera in a tweed
travelling-suit, but some one stopped that.&nbsp; At any rate he
had a beautiful time and they parted the best friends in the
world.&nbsp; Two years elapse and the Butterworths come abroad
and go to London.&nbsp; The first thing they see in all the
papers&mdash;in England those things are in the most prominent
place&mdash;is that the Duke of Green-Erin has arrived in <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>town for
the season.&nbsp; They wait a little, and then Mr.
Butterworth&mdash;as polite as ever&mdash;goes and leaves a
card.&nbsp; They wait a little more; the visit&rsquo;s not
returned; they wait three weeks: <i>silence de mort</i>, the Duke
gives no sign.&nbsp; The Butterworths see a lot of other people,
put down the Duke of Green-Erin as a rude ungrateful man and
forget all about him.&nbsp; One fine day they go to Ascot
Races&mdash;where they meet him face to face.&nbsp; He stares a
moment and then comes up to Mr. Butterworth, taking something
from his pocket-book&mdash;something which proves to be a
banknote.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Mr.
Butterworth,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;so that I can pay you that
ten pounds I lost to you in New York.&nbsp; I saw the other day
you remembered our bet; here are the ten pounds, Mr.
Butterworth.&nbsp; Good-bye, Mr. Butterworth.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
off he goes, and that&rsquo;s the last they see of the Duke of
Green-Erin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your story?&rdquo; asked Bessie Alden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t think it
interesting!&rdquo; her sister replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I believe it,&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate,
&ldquo;mademoiselle isn&rsquo;t of such an unspotted
<i>candeur</i>!&nbsp; Believe it or not as you like.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s at any rate no smoke without fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the way,&rdquo; asked Bessie after a moment,
&ldquo;that you expect your friends to treat you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I defy them to treat me very ill, for the simple reason
that I shall never give them the opportunity.&nbsp; With the best
will in the world, in that case, they can&rsquo;t be very
disobliging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young lady for a time said nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see what makes you talk that way,&rdquo; she then
resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The English are a great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly; and that&rsquo;s just the way they&rsquo;ve
grown great&mdash;by dropping you when you&rsquo;ve ceased to be
<a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>useful.&nbsp; People say they aren&rsquo;t clever, but
I find them prodigiously clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;ve liked them&mdash;all the
Englishmen you&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; Bessie brought up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve liked <i>me</i>,&rdquo; her sister
returned; &ldquo;so I think I&rsquo;d rather put it.&nbsp; And of
course one likes that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie pursued for some moments her studies in
sea-green.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether
they like me or not, I mean to like them.&nbsp; And
happily,&rdquo; she wound up, &ldquo;Lord Lambeth doesn&rsquo;t
owe me ten pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first few days after their arrival at Jones&rsquo;s
Hotel our charming Americans were much occupied with what they
would have called looking about them.&nbsp; They found occasion
to make numerous purchases, and their opportunities for inquiry
and comment were only those supplied by the deferential London
shopmen.&nbsp; Bessie Alden, even in driving from the station,
felt to intensity the many-voiced appeal of the capital of the
race from which she had sprung, and, at the risk of exhibiting
her as a person of vulgar tastes, it must be recorded that for
many days she desired no higher pleasure than to roll about the
crowded streets in the public conveyances.&nbsp; They presented
to her attentive eyes strange pictures and figures, and
it&rsquo;s at least beneath the dignity of our historic muse to
enumerate the trivial objects and incidents in which the
imagination of this simple young lady from Boston lost
itself.&nbsp; It may be freely mentioned, however, that whenever,
after a round of visits in Bond Street and Regent Street, she was
about to return with her sister to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, she
desired they should, at whatever cost to convenience, be driven
home by way of Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; She had begun by asking
if it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to take the Tower <i>en
route</i> to their lodgings; but it happened that at a more
primitive stage of her culture Mrs. Westgate <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>had paid a
visit to this venerable relic, which she spoke of ever
afterwards, vaguely, as a dreadful disappointment.&nbsp; She thus
expressed the liveliest disapproval of any attempt to combine
historical researches with the purchase of hair-brushes and
notepaper.&nbsp; The most she would consent to do in the line of
backward brooding was to spend half an hour at Madame
Tussaud&rsquo;s, where she saw several dusty wax effigies of
members of the Royal Family.&nbsp; It was made clear to Bessie
that if she wished to go to the Tower she must get some one else
to take her.&nbsp; Bessie expressed hereupon an earnest
disposition to go alone; but in respect to this proposal as well
Mrs. Westgate had the cold sense of complications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not
in your innocent little Boston.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a question
of walking up and down Beacon Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; With which she
went on to explain that there were two classes of American girls
in Europe&mdash;those who walked about alone and those who
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;You happen to belong, my dear,&rdquo;
she said to her sister, &ldquo;to the class that
doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only,&rdquo; laughed Bessie, though all
yearningly, &ldquo;because you happen quite arbitrarily to place
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she devoted much private meditation to this
question of effecting a visit to the Tower of London.</p>
<p>Suddenly it seemed as if the problem might be solved; the two
ladies at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel received a visit from Willie
Woodley.&nbsp; So was familiarly designated a young American who
had sailed from New York a few days after their own departure and
who, enjoying some freedom of acquaintance with them in that
city, had lost no time, on his arrival in London, in coming to
pay them his respects.&nbsp; He had in fact gone to see them
directly after going to see his tailor; than which there can be
no greater exhibition of promptitude on the part of a young
American just <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>installed at the Charing Cross Hotel.&nbsp; He was a
slight, mild youth, without high colour but with many elegant
forms, famous for the authority with which he led the
&ldquo;German&rdquo; in New York.&nbsp; He was indeed, by the
young ladies who habitually figured in such evolutions, reckoned
&ldquo;the best dancer in the world&rdquo;; it was in those terms
he was always spoken of and his pleasant identity
indicated.&nbsp; He was the most convenient gentle young man, for
almost any casual light purpose, it was possible to meet; he was
beautifully dressed&mdash;&ldquo;in the English
style&rdquo;&mdash;and knew an immense deal about London.&nbsp;
He had been at Newport during the previous summer, at the time of
our young Englishmen&rsquo;s visit, and he took extreme pleasure
in the society of Bessie Alden, whom he never addressed but as
&ldquo;Miss Bessie.&rdquo;&nbsp; She immediately arranged with
him, in the presence of her sister, that he should guide her to
the scene of Lady Jane Grey&rsquo;s execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do as you please,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only&mdash;if you desire the
information&mdash;it is not the custom here for young ladies to
knock about London with wild young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bessie has waltzed with me so often&mdash;not to
call it so wildly,&rdquo; the young man returned, &ldquo;that she
can surely go out with me in a jog-trot cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider public waltzing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate,
&ldquo;the most innocent, because the most guarded and regulated,
pleasure of our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly compliment to our time!&rdquo; Mr.
Woodley cried with a laugh of the most candid significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should regard what&rsquo;s done
here,&rdquo; Bessie pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I suffer the
restrictions of a society of which I enjoy none of the
privileges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good&mdash;very good,&rdquo; her
friend applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the Tower and feel the axe if you
like!&rdquo; <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>said Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I consent to your
going with Mr. Woodley; but I wouldn&rsquo;t let you go with an
Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bessie wouldn&rsquo;t care to go with an
Englishman!&rdquo; Mr. Woodley declared with an asperity
doubtless not unnatural in a young man who, dressing in a manner
that I have indicated and knowing a great deal, as I have said,
about London, saw no reason for drawing these sharp
distinctions.&nbsp; He agreed upon a day with Miss Bessie&mdash;a
day of that same week; while an ingenious mind might perhaps have
traced a connexion between the girl&rsquo;s reference to her lack
of social privilege or festal initiation and a question she asked
on the morrow as she sat with her sister at luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean to write to&mdash;to any
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote this morning to Captain Littledale,&rdquo; Mrs.
Westgate replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Woodley believes Captain Littledale away in
India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he thought he had heard so; he knows nothing
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Bessie said nothing more; then at last,
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you intend to write to&mdash;to Mr.
Beaumont?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Her sister waited with a look at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean to
Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said Mr. Beaumont because he was&mdash;at
Newport&mdash;so good a friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate prolonged the attitude of sisterly truth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care two straws for Mr.
Beaumont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were certainly very nice to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very nice to every one,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate simply.</p>
<p>Nothing indeed could have been simpler save perhaps the way
Bessie smiled back: &ldquo;To every one but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Her
sister continued to look at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you in love
with Lord Lambeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young woman stared a moment, and the question was too
unattended with any train even to make her shy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you are,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate went on,
&ldquo;I shall certainly not send for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves what I said,&rdquo; Bessie gaily
insisted&mdash;&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not really nice to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a poor service, my dear child,&rdquo; said
her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what sense?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing
<i>against</i> Lord Lambeth that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate seemed to cover much country in a few
moments.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <i>are</i> in love with him
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie stared again, but this time blushing a little.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, if you&rsquo;ll not be serious we won&rsquo;t mention
him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes accordingly Lord Lambeth was shrouded in
silence, and it was Mrs. Westgate who, at the end of this period,
removed the ban.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I shall let him know
we&rsquo;re here.&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;d be hurt&mdash;justly
enough&mdash;if we should go away without seeing him.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s fair to give him a chance to come and thank me for the
kindness we showed him.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t want to seem
eager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Bessie very simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I confess,&rdquo; her companion added,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m curious to see how he&rsquo;ll
behave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He behaved very well at Newport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newport isn&rsquo;t London.&nbsp; At Newport he could
do as he liked; but here it&rsquo;s another affair.&nbsp; He has
to have an eye to consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had more freedom then at Newport,&rdquo; argued
Bessie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the more to his credit that he behaved
well; and if he has to be so careful here it&rsquo;s possible
he&rsquo;ll behave even better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>&ldquo;Better, better?&rdquo; echoed her sister a
little impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear child, what do you mean
by better and what&rsquo;s your point of view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> mean by my
point of view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for Lord Lambeth&mdash;a tiny
speck?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate demanded.</p>
<p>This time Bessie Alden took it with still deeper
reserve.&nbsp; She slowly got up from table, turning her face
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll oblige me by not talking
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate sat watching her for some moments as she moved
slowly about the room and went and stood at the window.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to him this afternoon,&rdquo; she said at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you please!&rdquo; Bessie answered; after which
she turned round.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid to say I like
Lord Lambeth.&nbsp; I like him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate bethought herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there have been clever people whom I&rsquo;ve
disliked,&rdquo; the girl said; &ldquo;so I suppose I may like a
stupid one.&nbsp; Besides, Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s no stupider than
any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No stupider than he gives you warning of,&rdquo; her
sister smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were in love with him as you said just now,&rdquo;
Bessie returned, &ldquo;it would be bad policy on your part to
abuse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, don&rsquo;t give me lessons in
policy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The policy I
mean to follow is very deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl began once more to walk about; then she stopped
before her companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard in the
course of five minutes so many hints and innuendoes.&nbsp; I wish
you&rsquo;d tell me in plain English what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean you may be much annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s still only a hint,&rdquo; said
Bessie.</p>
<p>Her sister just hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be said of you
that you&rsquo;ve come after him&mdash;that you followed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie threw back her pretty head much as a startled hind, and
a look flashed into her face that made Mrs. Westgate get
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who says such things as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a very convenient faculty of doubt.&nbsp;
But my policy will be, as I say, very deep.&nbsp; I shall leave
you to find out as many things as possible for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie fixed her eyes on her sister, and Mrs. Westgate could
have believed there were tears in them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they talk
that way here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; I shall let you
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me alone,&rdquo; said Bessie
Alden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I want to see what you make of it,&rdquo; her
sister continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand after Lord Lambeth has
come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate with a persistence of private
amusement.</p>
<p>The two ladies had arranged that on this afternoon Willie
Woodley should go with them to Hyde Park, where Bessie expected
it would prove a rich passage to have sat on a little green chair
under the great trees and beside Rotten Row.&nbsp; The want of a
suitable escort had hitherto hampered this adventure; but no
escort, now, for such an expedition, could have been more
suitable than their devoted young countryman, whose mission in
life, it might almost be said, was to find chairs for ladies and
who appeared on the stroke of half-past five adorned with every
superficial grace that could qualify him for the scene.</p>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written to Lord Lambeth, my
dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate mentioned on coming into the room
where Bessie, drawing on long grey gloves, had given their
visitor the impression that she was particularly attuned.&nbsp;
Bessie said nothing, but Willie Woodley exclaimed that his
lordship was in town; he had seen his name in the <i>Morning
Post</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you read the <i>Morning
Post</i>?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate thereupon asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; it&rsquo;s great fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Woodley
almost spoke as if the pleasure were attended with physical
risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want so to see it,&rdquo; said Bessie,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s so much about it in Thackeray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send it to you every morning!&rdquo; cried
the young man with elation.</p>
<p>He found them what Bessie thought excellent places under the
great trees and beside the famous avenue the humours of which had
been made familiar to the girl&rsquo;s childhood by the pictures
in <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; The day was bright and warm and the crowd
of riders and spectators, as well as the great procession of
carriages, proportionately dense and many-coloured.&nbsp; The
scene bore the stamp of the London social pressure at its
highest, and it made our young woman think of more things than
she could easily express to her companions.&nbsp; She sat silent,
under her parasol, while her imagination, according to its wont,
kept pace with the deep strong tide of the exhibition.&nbsp; Old
impressions and preconceptions became living things before the
show, and she found herself, amid the crowd of images, fitting a
history to this person and a theory to that, and making a place
for them all in her small private museum of types.&nbsp; But if
she said little her sister on one side and Willie Woodley on the
other delivered themselves in lively alternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that green dress with blue flounces.&nbsp;
Quelle toilette!&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Marquis of Blackborough,&rdquo;
the young man was able to contribute&mdash;&ldquo;the one in the
queer white coat.&nbsp; I heard him speak the other night in the
House of Lords; it was something about ramrods; he called them
<i>wamwods</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an awful swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like the way they&rsquo;re
pinned back?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
never know where to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do nothing but stop,&rdquo; said Willie
Woodley.&nbsp; &ldquo;It prevents them from walking.&nbsp; Here
comes a great celebrity&mdash;Lady Beatrice Bellevue.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s awfully fast; see what little steps she
takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate pursued to Bessie,
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re getting some ideas for your
couturi&egrave;re?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting plenty of ideas,&rdquo; said Bessie,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that my couturi&egrave;re would
particularly appreciate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their companion presently perceived a mounted friend who drew
up beside the barrier of the Row and beckoned to him.&nbsp; He
went forward and the crowd of pedestrians closed about him, so
that for some minutes he was hidden from sight.&nbsp; At last he
reappeared, bringing a gentleman with him&mdash;a gentleman whom
Bessie at first supposed to be his friend dismounted.&nbsp; But
at a second glance she found herself looking at Lord Lambeth, who
was shaking hands with her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found him over there,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley,
&ldquo;and I told him you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Lord Lambeth, raising his hat afresh, shook hands
with Bessie&mdash;&ldquo;Fancy your being here!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was blushing and smiling; he looked very handsome and he had a
note of splendour he had not had in America.&nbsp; The
girl&rsquo;s free fancy, as we know, was just then in marked
exercise; so that the tall young Englishman, as he stood there
looking down at her, <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>had the benefit of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s handsomer and more splendid than anything
I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; And then
she remembered he was a Marquis and she thought he somehow looked
a Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, you know,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you ought to
have let a fellow know you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to you an hour ago,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t all the world know it?&rdquo; smiled
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I didn&rsquo;t know it!&rdquo; he
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my honour I hadn&rsquo;t heard of
it.&nbsp; Ask Woodley now; had I, Woodley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re rather a humbug,&rdquo; this
gentleman brought forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that&mdash;do you, Miss
Alden?&rdquo; asked his lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
believe I&rsquo;m rather a humbug, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie after an instant, but choosing
and conferring a grace on the literal&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too tall to stand up, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo;
Mrs. Westgate pronounced.&nbsp; &ldquo;You approach the normal
only when you sit down.&nbsp; Be so good as to get a
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found one and placed it sidewise, close to the two
ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t met Woodley I should never
have found you,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should I,
Woodley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess not,&rdquo; said the young American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even with my letter?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I haven&rsquo;t got your letter yet; I
suppose I shall get it this evening.&nbsp; It was awfully kind of
you to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said to Bessie,&rdquo; the elder lady
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Did</i> she say so, Miss Alden?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth
a little pointlessly inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay
you&rsquo;ve been here a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here three,&rdquo; mocked Mrs.
Westgate.</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&ldquo;<i>Have</i> you been here three months?&rdquo;
the young man asked again of Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a long time,&rdquo; Bessie answered.</p>
<p>He had but a brief wonder&mdash;he found something.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say, after that you had better not call me a
humbug!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only been in town three weeks, but you
must have been hiding away.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen you
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where should you have seen us&mdash;where should we
have gone?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate fairly put to him.</p>
<p>It found Willie Woodley at least ready.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
should have gone to Hurlingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let Lord Lambeth tell us,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of places to go to,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;&ldquo;each one stupider than the other.&nbsp; I mean
people&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; They send you cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has sent us a scrap of a card,&rdquo; Bessie
laughed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate attenuated.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very
quiet.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re here as travellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Bessie further mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we should find your image there,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Westgate&mdash;&ldquo;yours and Mr.
Beaumont&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Chamber of Horrors?&rdquo; laughed the young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did duty very well for a party,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the women were
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;es</i>, and many of the figures looked
as if they could almost speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; his lordship returned, &ldquo;you
see people at London parties who look a long way from
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mr. Woodley could find us Mr.
Beaumont?&rdquo; asked the elder of the ladies.</p>
<p>He stared and looked about.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay he
could.&nbsp; <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>Percy sometimes comes here.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
you could find him, Woodley?&nbsp; Make a dive or a dash for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I&rsquo;ve had enough of violent
movement,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wait till Mr. Beaumont comes to the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him to see you,&rdquo; said Lord
Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the address in my
letter&mdash;Jones&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one of those places just out of Piccadilly?&nbsp;
Beastly hole, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the best hotel in London,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they give you awful rubbish to eat, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; his lordship went on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate practised the same serenity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always feel so sorry for people who come up to town
and go to live in those dens,&rdquo; continued the young
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;They eat nothing but filth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; cried Willie Woodley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and how do you like London, Miss Alden?&rdquo;
Lord Lambeth asked, unperturbed by this ejaculation.</p>
<p>The girl was prompt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister likes it, in spite of the
&lsquo;filth&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope then you&rsquo;re going to stop a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as I can,&rdquo; Bessie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s wonderful Mr. Westgate?&rdquo; asked
Lord Lambeth of this gentleman&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s where he always is&mdash;in that tiresome
New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have staying power,&rdquo; said the young
man.</p>
<p>She appeared to consider.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, he stays ahead of
every one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>Lord
Lambeth sat nearly an hour with his American friends; but it is
not our purpose to relate their conversation in full.&nbsp; He
addressed a great many remarks to the younger lady and finally
turned toward her altogether, while Willie Woodley wasted a
certain amount of effort to regale Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; Bessie
herself was sparing of effusion; she thought, on her guard, of
what her sister had said to her at luncheon.&nbsp; Little by
little, however, she interested herself again in her English
friend very much as she had done at Newport; only it seemed to
her he might here become more interesting.&nbsp; He would be an
unconscious part of the antiquity, the impressiveness, the
picturesqueness of England; of all of which things poor Bessie
Alden, like most familiars of the overciphered <i>tabula
rasa</i>, was terribly at the mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wished I were back at Newport,&rdquo;
the young man candidly stated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those days I spent at
your sister&rsquo;s were awfully jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We enjoyed them very much; I hope your father&rsquo;s
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear yes.&nbsp; When I got to England the old humbug
was out grouse-shooting.&nbsp; It was what you call in America a
gigantic fraud.&nbsp; My mother had got nervous.&nbsp; My three
weeks at Newport seemed a happy dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America certainly is very different from
England,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you like England better, eh?&rdquo; he returned
almost persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Englishman can ask that seriously of a person of
another country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his cheerful brown eyes on her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mean it&rsquo;s a matter of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were English,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;it would
certainly seem to me a matter of course that every one should be
a good patriot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes; patriotism&rsquo;s
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; He appeared not quite to follow, but was
clearly contented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now what are you going to do
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday I&rsquo;m going to the Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tower of London.&nbsp; Did you never hear of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve been there,&rdquo; said Lord
Lambeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was taken there by my governess when I
was six years old.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rum idea your going
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do give me a few more rum ideas then.&nbsp; I want to
see everything of that sort.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to Hampton
Court and to Windsor and to the Dulwich Gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed greatly amused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder you
don&rsquo;t go to Rosherville Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie yearned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they weirdly old?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I care
for,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tremendously old; they&rsquo;re all
falling to ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s
nothing so charming as an old ruinous garden.&nbsp; We must
certainly go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friend broke out into mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, Woodley,
here&rsquo;s Miss Alden wants to go down to Rosherville
Gardens!&nbsp; Hang it, they <i>are</i>
&lsquo;weird&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie Woodley looked a little blank; he was caught in the
fact of ignorance of an apparently conspicuous feature of London
life.&nbsp; But in a moment he turned it off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write for a
permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s exhilaration increased.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gad, I believe that, to get your money&rsquo;s
worth over here, you Americans would go anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish to go to Parliament,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the first things.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>&ldquo;Ah, it would bore you to death!&rdquo; he
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish to hear you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never speak&mdash;except to young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him from under the shade of her parasol.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very strange,&rdquo; she then quietly
concluded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I approve of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now don&rsquo;t be severe, Miss Alden!&rdquo; he
cried with the note of sincerity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
be severe.&nbsp; I want you to like me&mdash;awfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To like you awfully?&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t laugh at
me then when I make mistakes.&nbsp; I regard it as my
right&mdash;as a free-born American&mdash;to make as many
mistakes as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word I didn&rsquo;t laugh at you,&rdquo; the
young man pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not only that,&rdquo; Bessie went on; &ldquo;but I
hold that all my mistakes should be set down to my credit.&nbsp;
You must think the better of me for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think better of you than I do,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>
<p>Again, shadily, she took him in.&nbsp; &ldquo;You certainly
speak very well to young ladies.&nbsp; But why don&rsquo;t you
address the House?&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that what they call
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a great position?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>He looked a moment at the back of his glove.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set that down as one of your mistakes&mdash;to
your credit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as if he disliked talking about his
position he changed the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d
let me go with you to the Tower and to Hampton Court and to all
those other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be most happy,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course I shall be delighted to show you the
Houses of Parliament&mdash;some day that suits you.&nbsp; There
are a lot of things I want to do for you.&nbsp; I want you to
have a good time.&nbsp; And I should like very much to present
some of my friends to you if it wouldn&rsquo;t <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>bore
you.&nbsp; Then it would be awfully kind of you to come down to
Branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re much obliged to you, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo;
said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what may Branches be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a house in the country.&nbsp; I think you
might like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie Woodley and Mrs. Westgate were at this moment sitting
in silence, and the young man&rsquo;s ear caught these last words
of the other pair.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s inviting Miss Bessie
to one of his castles,&rdquo; he murmured to his companion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate hereupon, foreseeing what she mentally called
&ldquo;complications,&rdquo; immediately got up; and the two
ladies, taking leave of their English friend, returned, under
conduct of their American, to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<h3><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>V</h3>
<p>Lord Lambeth came to see them on the morrow, bringing Percy
Beaumont with him&mdash;the latter having at once declared his
intention of neglecting none of the usual offices of
civility.&nbsp; This declaration, however, on his kinsman&rsquo;s
informing him of the advent of the two ladies, had been preceded
by another exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are then and you&rsquo;re in for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what am I in for?&rdquo; the younger man had
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let your mother give it a name.&nbsp; With
all respect to whom,&rdquo; Percy had added, &ldquo;I must
decline on this occasion to do any more police duty.&nbsp; The
Duchess must look after you herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her a chance,&rdquo; the
Duchess&rsquo;s son had returned a trifle grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall make her go and see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do it, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lord
Lambeth.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Beaumont took a subtle view of the arrival of the
fair strangers at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel he was sufficiently capable
of a still deeper refinement to offer them a smiling
countenance.&nbsp; He fell into animated
conversation&mdash;conversation animated at least on <i>her</i>
side&mdash;with Mrs. Westgate, while his companion appealed more
confusedly to the younger lady.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate began
confessing and protesting, declaring and discriminating.</p>
<p><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>&ldquo;I must say London&rsquo;s a great deal brighter
and prettier just now than it was when I was here last&mdash;in
the month of November.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidently a great deal
going on, and you seem to have a good many flowers.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s very charming for all you people
and that you amuse yourselves immensely.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
good of you to let Bessie and me come and sit and look at
you.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m very satirical,
but I must confess that that&rsquo;s the feeling I have in
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t quite understand to what
feeling you allude,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feeling that it&rsquo;s all very well for you
English people.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s beautifully arranged for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me it&rsquo;s very well arranged here for
some Americans sometimes,&rdquo; Percy plucked up spirit to
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some of them, yes&mdash;if they like to be
patronised.&nbsp; But I must say I don&rsquo;t like to be
patronised.&nbsp; I may be very eccentric and undisciplined and
unreasonable, but I confess I never was fond of patronage.&nbsp;
I like to associate with people on the same terms as I do in my
own country; that&rsquo;s a peculiar taste that I have.&nbsp; But
here people seem to expect something else&mdash;really I
can&rsquo;t make out quite what.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m very ungrateful, for I certainly
have received in one way and another a great deal of
attention.&nbsp; The last time I was here a lady sent me a
message that I was at liberty to come and pay her my
respects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I hope you didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Mr.
Beaumont cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deliciously na&iuml;f, I must say that for
you!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate promptly pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must
be a great advantage to you here in London.&nbsp; I suppose that
if I myself had a little more na&iuml;vet&eacute;&mdash;of your
blessed national lack of any approach to a sense for <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>shades&mdash;I should enjoy it more.&nbsp; I should be
content to sit on a chair in the Park and see the people pass, to
be told that this is the Duchess of Suffolk and that the Lord
Chamberlain, and that I must be thankful for the privilege of
beholding them.&nbsp; I daresay it&rsquo;s very peevish and
critical of me to ask for anything else.&nbsp; But I was always
critical&mdash;it&rsquo;s the joy of my life&mdash;and I freely
confess to the sin of being fastidious.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m told
there&rsquo;s some remarkably superior second-rate society
provided here for strangers.&nbsp; <i>Merci</i>!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want any superior second-rate society.&nbsp; I want
the society I&rsquo;ve been accustomed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy mustered a rueful gaiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you
don&rsquo;t call Lambeth and me second-rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m accustomed to you!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know you English sometimes make the
most wonderful speeches?&nbsp; The first time I came to London I
went out to dine&mdash;as I told you, I&rsquo;ve received a great
deal of attention.&nbsp; After dinner, in the drawing-room, I had
some conversation with an old lady&mdash;no, you mustn&rsquo;t
look that way: I assure you I had!&nbsp; I forget what we talked
about, but she presently said, in allusion to something we were
discussing: &lsquo;Oh, you know, the aristocracy do so-and-so,
but in one&rsquo;s own class of life it&rsquo;s very
different.&rsquo;&nbsp; In one&rsquo;s own class of life!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s a poor unprotected American woman to do in a country
where she is liable to have that sort of thing said to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say she&rsquo;s not to mind, not a
rap&mdash;though you seem to get hold of some very queer old
ladies.&nbsp; I compliment you on your acquaintance!&rdquo; Percy
pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to bring me to admit
that London&rsquo;s an odious place you&rsquo;ll not
succeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m extremely fond of it and think it the
jolliest place in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pour vous autres&mdash;I never said the
contrary,&rdquo; <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>Mrs. Westgate retorted&mdash;an expression made use of,
this last, because both interlocutors had begun to raise their
voices.&nbsp; Mr. Beaumont naturally didn&rsquo;t like to hear
the seat of his existence abused, and Mrs. Westgate, no less
naturally, didn&rsquo;t like a stubborn debater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth; &ldquo;what are they
up to now?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he came away from the window, where
he had been standing with Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with a very clever countrywoman of
mine,&rdquo; the elder lady continued with charming ardour even
if with imperfect relevancy.&nbsp; She smiled at the two
gentlemen for a moment with terrible brightness, as if to toss at
their feet&mdash;upon their native heath&mdash;the gauntlet of
defiance.&nbsp; &ldquo;For me there are only two social positions
worth speaking of&mdash;that of an American lady and that of the
Emperor of Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do with the American gentlemen?&rdquo;
asked Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She leaves them in America!&rdquo; said his
comrade.</p>
<p>On the departure of their visitors Bessie mentioned that Lord
Lambeth would come the next day, to go with them to the Tower,
and that he had kindly offered to bring his &ldquo;trap&rdquo;
and drive them all through the city.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate listened
in silence to this news and for some time afterwards also said
nothing.&nbsp; But at last, &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t requested
me the other day not to speak of it,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d make bold to ask
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bessie frowned a little; her dark blue eyes
grew more dark than blue.&nbsp; But her sister went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As it is I&rsquo;ll take the risk.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not
in love with Lord Lambeth: I believe it perfectly.&nbsp; Very
good.&nbsp; But is there by chance any danger of your becoming
so?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very simple question&mdash;don&rsquo;t
take offence.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a particular reason,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;for wanting to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>Bessie for some moments said nothing; she only looked
displeased.&nbsp; &ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; she
at last answered with a certain dryness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should like to frighten them!&rdquo; cried her
sister, clasping jewelled hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To frighten whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these people.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s family and
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;How should you frighten
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be I&mdash;it would be you.&nbsp; It
would frighten them to suppose you holding in thrall his
lordship&rsquo;s young affections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young lady, her clear eyes still overshadowed by her dark
brows, continued to examine it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should that
frighten them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate winged her shaft with a smile before launching
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because they think you&rsquo;re not good
enough.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a charming girl, beautiful and
amiable, intelligent and clever, and as
<i>bien-&eacute;lev&eacute;e</i> as it is possible to be; but
you&rsquo;re not a fit match for Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie showed again a coldness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you get
such extraordinary ideas?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve said some such odd
things lately.&nbsp; My dear Kitty, where do you collect
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kitty, unabashed, held to her idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it
would put them on pins and needles, and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt
you.&nbsp; Mr. Beaumont&rsquo;s already most uneasy.&nbsp; I
could soon see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned it over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean they spy on
him, that they interfere with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what power they have to interfere,
but I know that a British <i>materfamilias</i>&mdash;and when
she&rsquo;s a Duchess into the bargain&mdash;is often a force to
be reckoned with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has already been intimated that before certain <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>appearances
of strange or sinister cast our young woman was apt to shy off
into scepticism.&nbsp; She abstained on the present occasion from
expressing disbelief, for she wished not to irritate her
sister.&nbsp; But she said to herself that Kitty had been
misinformed&mdash;that this was a traveller&rsquo;s tale.&nbsp;
Though she was a girl of quick imagination there could in the
nature of things be no truth for her in the attribution to her of
a vulgar identity.&nbsp; Only the form she gave her doubt was:
&ldquo;I must say that in that case I&rsquo;m very sorry for Lord
Lambeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate, more and more exhilarated by her own scheme,
irradiated interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could only believe it was
safe!&nbsp; But when you begin to pity him I, on my side, am
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of your pitying him too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie turned impatiently off&mdash;then at the end of a
minute faced about.&nbsp; &ldquo;What if I <i>should</i> pity him
too much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate hereupon averted herself, but after a
moment&rsquo;s reflexion met the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would
come, after all, to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth came the next day with his trap, when the two
ladies, attended by Willie Woodley, placed themselves under his
guidance and were conveyed eastward, through some of the most
fascinating, as Bessie called them, even though the duskiest
districts, to the great turreted donjon that overlooks the London
shipping.&nbsp; They alighted together to enter the famous
fortress, where they secured the services of a venerable
beef-eater, who, ignoring the presence of other dependants on his
leisure, made a fine exclusive party of them and marched them
through courts and corridors, through armouries and
prisons.&nbsp; He delivered his usual peripatetic discourse, and
they stopped and stared and peeped and stooped according as he <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>marshalled
and directed them.&nbsp; Bessie appealed to this
worthy&mdash;even on more heads than he seemed aware of; she
overtaxed, in her earnestness, his learnt lesson and found the
place, as she more than once mentioned to him, quite
delirious.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth was in high good-humour; his
delirium at least was gay and he betrayed afresh that aptitude
for the simpler forms of ironic comment that the girl had noted
in him.&nbsp; Willie Woodley kept looking at the ceilings and
tapping the walls with the knuckle of a pearl-grey glove; and
Mrs. Westgate, asking at frequent intervals to be allowed to sit
down and wait till they came back, was as frequently informed
that they would never do anything so weak.&nbsp; When it befell
that Bessie&rsquo;s glowing appeals, chiefly on collateral points
of English history, but left the warder gaping she resorted
straight to Lord Lambeth.&nbsp; His lordship then pleaded gross
incompetence, declaring he knew nothing about that sort of thing
and greatly diverted, to all appearance, at being treated as an
authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t honestly expect people to know as
awfully much as you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should expect you to know a great deal more,&rdquo;
Bessie Alden returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, women always know more than men about names and
dates and historical characters,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was Lady Jane Grey we&rsquo;ve just been hearing
about, who went in for Latin and Greek and all the learning of
her age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> have no right to be ignorant at all
events,&rdquo; Bessie argued with all her freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I as good a right as any one
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve lived in the midst of all these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things do you mean?&nbsp; Axes and blocks and
thumbscrews?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;All these historical things.&nbsp; You belong to
an historical family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessie really harks back too much to the dead
past&mdash;she makes too much of it,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate opined,
catching the sense of this colloquy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you hark back,&rdquo; the young man laughed,
thankful for a formula.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do make too much of the
dead past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went with the ladies a couple of days later to Hampton
Court, Willie Woodley being also of the party.&nbsp; The
afternoon was charming, the famous horse-chestnuts blossomed to
admiration, and Lord Lambeth, who found in Miss Alden the
improving governess, he declared, of his later immaturity, as
Mademoiselle Boquet, dragging him by the hand to view all lions,
had been that of his earliest, pronounced the old red palace not
half so beastly as he had supposed.&nbsp; Bessie herself rose to
raptures; she went about murmuring and
&ldquo;raving.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too lovely;
it&rsquo;s too enchanting; it&rsquo;s too exactly what it ought
to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Hampton Court the tinkling flocks are not provided with an
official bellwether, but are left to browse at discretion on the
tough herbage of History.&nbsp; It happened in this manner that,
in default of another informant, our young woman, who on doubtful
questions was able to suggest a great many alternatives, found
herself again apply for judicious support to Lord Lambeth.&nbsp;
He, however, could but once more declare himself a broken reed
and that his education, in such matters, had been sadly
neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry it makes you so wretched,&rdquo; he
further professed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so disappointing, you know,&rdquo; she
returned; but more in pity&mdash;pity for herself&mdash;than in
anger.</p>
<p><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>&ldquo;Ah, now, don&rsquo;t say that!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the worst thing you could possibly say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke with a sad
lucidity&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so bad as to say that I had
expected nothing of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;&mdash;and he seemed to
rejoice in a chance to demur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me a notion of
the sort of thing you expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that you&rsquo;d be more what I should like to
be&mdash;what I should try to be&mdash;in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my place!&rdquo; he groaned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always talking about my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gave him a look; he might have thought she coloured;
and for a little she made no rejoinder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does it
strike you that I&rsquo;m always talking about your
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do it a great honour,&rdquo; he said
as if fearing he had sounded uncivil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought about it,&rdquo; she went on
after a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought of your
future as an hereditary legislator.&nbsp; An hereditary
legislator ought to know so many things, oughtn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he doesn&rsquo;t legislate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>will</i> legislate one of these
days&mdash;you may have to at any time; it&rsquo;s absurd your
saying you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re very much looked up to
here&mdash;I&rsquo;m assured of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ever noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re used to it then.&nbsp;
You ought to fill the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, fill it?&rdquo; asked Lord
Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be very clever and brilliant&mdash;to be
&lsquo;up&rsquo; in almost everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on her his handsome young face of profane
wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I tell you something?&nbsp; A young
man in my position, as you call it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t invent the term,&rdquo; she
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it in a great many
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, you&rsquo;re always at your books!&nbsp; A
fellow in my position then does well enough at the worst&mdash;he
muddles along whatever he does.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about what I
mean to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if your own people are content with you,&rdquo;
Bessie laughed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for me to complain.&nbsp;
But I shall always think that properly you should have a great
mind&mdash;a great character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very theoretic!&rdquo; the young man
promptly brought out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Depend upon it, that&rsquo;s a
Yankee prejudice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy the country then,&rdquo; she as eagerly declared,
&ldquo;where people&rsquo;s prejudices make so for
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short, with his slightly strained gaiety, as for
the pleasantness of high argument.&nbsp; &ldquo;What it comes to
then is that we&rsquo;re all here a pack of fools and me the
biggest of the lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said nothing so rude of a great people&mdash;and a
great person.&nbsp; But I must repeat that you personally
are&mdash;in your representative capacity that&rsquo;s to
be&mdash;disappointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Alden,&rdquo; he simply cried at this,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best fellow in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if it were not for that!&rdquo; she beautifully
smiled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate had many more friends in London than she
pretended, and before long had renewed acquaintance with most of
them.&nbsp; Their hospitality was prompt, so that, one thing
leading to another, she began, as the phrase is, to go out.&nbsp;
Bessie Alden, in this way, saw a good deal of what she took great
pleasure in calling to herself English society.&nbsp; She went to
balls and danced, she went to dinners and talked, she went to
concerts and listened&mdash;at concerts Bessie always
listened&mdash;she went to exhibitions and <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>wondered.&nbsp; Her enjoyment was keen and her
curiosity insatiable, and, grateful in general for all her
opportunities, she especially prized the privilege of meeting
certain celebrated persons, authors and artists, philosophers and
statesmen, of whose renown she had been a humble and distant
beholder and who now, as part of the frequent furniture of London
drawing-rooms, struck her as stars fallen from the firmament and
become palpable&mdash;revealing also sometimes on contact
qualities not to have been predicted of bodies sidereal.&nbsp;
Bessie, who knew so many of her contemporaries by reputation,
lost in this way certain fond illusions; but on the other hand
she had innumerable satisfactions and enthusiasms, and she laid
bare the wealth of her emotions to a dear friend of her own sex
in Boston, with whom she was in voluminous correspondence.&nbsp;
Some of her sentiments indeed she sought mildly to flash upon
Lord Lambeth, who came almost every day to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel
and whom Mrs. Westgate admitted to be really devoted.&nbsp;
Captain Littledale, it appeared, had gone to India; and of
several others of this lady&rsquo;s ex-pensioners&mdash;gentlemen
who, as she said, had made, in New York, a club-house of her
drawing-room&mdash;no tidings were to be obtained; but this
particular friend of other days was certainly attentive enough to
make up for the accidental absences, the short memories, the
remarked lapses, of every one else.&nbsp; He drove the sisters in
the Park, took them to visit private collections of pictures and,
having a house of his own, invited them to luncheon, to tea, to
dinner, to supper even after the arduous German opera.&nbsp; Mrs.
Westgate, following the fashion of many of her countrywomen,
caused herself and her companion to be presented at the English
Court by her diplomatic representative&mdash;for it was in this
manner that she alluded to the American Minister to England,
inquiring what on earth he <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>was put there for if not to make the
proper arrangements for her reception at Court.</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth expressed a hatred of Courts, but he had social
privileges or exercised some court function&mdash;these
undiscriminated attributes, dim backgrounds where old gold seemed
to shine through transparent conventions, were romantically rich
to our young heroine&mdash;that involved his support of his
sovereign on the day on which the two ladies at Jones&rsquo;s
Hotel repaired to Buckingham Palace in a remarkable coach sent by
his lordship to fetch them.&nbsp; He appeared in a gorgeous
uniform, and Bessie Alden was particularly struck with his
glory&mdash;especially when on her asking him, rather foolishly
as she felt, if he were a loyal subject, he replied that he was a
loyal subject to herself.&nbsp; This pronouncement was emphasised
by his dancing with her at a royal ball to which the two ladies
afterwards went, and was not impaired by the fact that she
thought he danced very ill.&nbsp; He struck her as wonderfully
kind; she asked herself with growing vivacity why he should be so
kind.&nbsp; It was just his character&mdash;that seemed the
natural reply.&nbsp; She had told her relative how much she liked
him, and now that she liked him more she wondered at her
excess.&nbsp; She liked him for his clear nature; to this
question as well that seemed the natural answer.&nbsp; The truth
was that when once the impressions of London life began to crowd
thickly upon her she completely forgot her subtle sister&rsquo;s
warning on the cynicism of public opinion.&nbsp; It had given her
great pain at the moment; but there was no particular reason why
she should remember it: it corresponded too little with any
sensible reality.&nbsp; Besides which there was her habit, her
beautiful system, of consenting to know nothing of human baseness
or of the vulgar side.&nbsp; There were things, just as there
were people, that were as nought from the moment one ignored <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>them.&nbsp;
She was accordingly not haunted with the sense of a low
imputation.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t in love with Lord
Lambeth&mdash;she assured herself of that.&nbsp; It will
immediately be observed that when such assurances become
necessary the state of a young lady&rsquo;s affections is already
ambiguous; and indeed the girl made no attempt to dissimulate (to
her finer intelligence) that &ldquo;appeal of
type&rdquo;&mdash;she had a ready name for it&mdash;to which her
gallant hovering gentleman caused her wonderingly to
respond.&nbsp; She was fully aware that she liked it, this so
unalloyed image of the simple candid manly healthy English
temperament.&nbsp; She spoke to herself of it as if she liked the
man for it instead of her liking it for the man.&nbsp; She
cherished the thought of his bravery, which she had never in the
least seen tested, enjoyed a fond view in him of the free and
instinctive range of the &ldquo;gentlemanly&rdquo; character, and
was as familiar with his good looks as if she habitually handed
him out his neckties.&nbsp; She was perfectly conscious,
moreover, of privately dilating on his more adventitious
merits&mdash;of the effect on her imagination of the large
opportunities of so splendid a person; opportunities she hardly
knew for what, but, as she supposed, for doing great things, for
setting an example, for exerting an influence, for conferring
happiness, for encouraging the arts.&nbsp; She had an ideal of
conduct for a young man who should find himself in this grand
position, and she tried to adapt it to her friend&rsquo;s
behaviour as you might attempt to fit a silhouette in cut paper
over a shadow projected on a wall.&nbsp; Bessie Alden&rsquo;s
silhouette, however, refused to coincide at all points with his
lordship&rsquo;s figure; a want of harmony that she sometimes
deplored beyond discretion.&nbsp; It was his own affair she at
moments told herself&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t <i>her</i> concern the
least in the world.&nbsp; When he was absent it was of course
less striking&mdash;then he might have seemed sufficiently to <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>unite high
responsibilities with high braveries.&nbsp; But when he sat there
within sight, laughing and talking with his usual effect of
natural salubrity and mental mediocrity, she took the measure of
his shortcoming and felt acutely that if his position was, so to
speak, heroic, there was little of that large line in the young
man himself.&nbsp; Then her imagination wandered away from
him&mdash;very far away; for it was an incontestable fact that at
these moments he lagged ever so much behind it.&nbsp; He affected
her as on occasion, dreadful to say, almost <i>actively</i>
stupid.&nbsp; It may have been that while she so curiously
inquired and so critically brooded <i>her</i> personal wit, her
presence of mind, made no great show&mdash;though it is also
possible that she sometimes positively charmed, or at least
interested, her friend by this very betrayal of the frequent, the
distant and unreported, excursion.&nbsp; So it would have hung
together that a part of her unconscious appeal to him from the
first had been in his feeling her judge and appraise him more
freely and irresponsibly&mdash;more at her ease and her leisure,
as it were&mdash;than several young ladies with whom he had
passed for adventurously intimate.&nbsp; To be convinced of her
&ldquo;cleverness&rdquo; and yet also to be aware of her
appreciation&mdash;when the cleverness might have been after all
but dangerous and complicating&mdash;all made, to Lord
Lambeth&rsquo;s sense, for convenience and cheer.&nbsp;
Hadn&rsquo;t he compassed the satisfaction, that high aim of
young men greatly placed and greatly moneyed, of being liked for
himself?&nbsp; It was true a cynical counsellor might have
whispered to him: &ldquo;Liked for yourself?&nbsp; Ah, not so
very awfully <i>much</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had at any rate the
constant hope of adding to that quantity.</p>
<p>It may not seem to fit in&mdash;but the truth was
strange&mdash;that Bessie Alden, when he struck her as
&ldquo;deficient,&rdquo; found herself aspiring by that very <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>reason to
some finer way of liking him.&nbsp; This was fairly indeed on
grounds of conscience&mdash;because she felt he had been
thoroughly &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to her sister and so deemed it no
more than fair that she should think as well of him as he thought
of her.&nbsp; The effort in question was possibly sometimes not
so successful as it might have been, the result being at moments
an irritation, which, though consciously vague, was yet, with
inconsequence, acute enough to express itself in hostile
criticism of several British institutions.&nbsp; Bessie went to
entertainments at which she met Lord Lambeth, but also to others
at which he was neither actually nor imaginably present; and it
was chiefly at these latter that she encountered those literary
and artistic celebrities of whom mention has been made.&nbsp;
After a while she reduced the matter to a principle.&nbsp; If he
should appear anywhere she might take it for a flat sign that
there would be neither poets nor philosophers; and as a
result&mdash;for it was almost a direct result&mdash;she used to
enumerate to the young man these objects of her admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be awfully fond of that sort of
people,&rdquo; he said one day as if the idea had just occurred
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the people in England I&rsquo;m most
curious to see,&rdquo; she promptly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve read so
much,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth gallantly threw off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>not</i> read so much.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
because we think so much of them at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I see!&nbsp; In your so awfully clever
Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only in our awfully clever Boston, but in our just
commonly clever everywhere.&nbsp; We hold them in great
honour,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s they who go
to the best dinner-parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say I
know many of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would do you some good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it would,&rdquo; said the young man very
humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I must say I don&rsquo;t like the looks
of some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I&mdash;of some of them.&nbsp; But there are
all kinds, and many of them are charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked with two or three of them,&rdquo;
Lord Lambeth went on, &ldquo;and I thought they had a kind of
fawning manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they fawn?&rdquo; Bessie demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Why
indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you only thought so,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; her companion allowed,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a kind of thing that can&rsquo;t be
proved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America they don&rsquo;t fawn,&rdquo; she went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Ah, well, then they must be
better company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the few
things I don&rsquo;t like about England&mdash;your keeping the
distinguished people apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, apart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, letting them come only to certain places.&nbsp;
You never see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All his pleasant face wondered&mdash;he seemed to take it as
another of her rather stiff riddles.&nbsp; &ldquo;What people do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eminent people; the authors and artists; the clever
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there are other eminent people besides those!&rdquo;
said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly keep them apart,&rdquo; Bessie
earnestly contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are plenty of other clever people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was spoken with a fine simple faith, yet the tone of it
made her laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Plenty&rsquo;?&nbsp; How
many?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>On
another occasion&mdash;just after a dinner-party&mdash;she
mentioned something else in England she didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I say!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you
abused us enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never abused you at all,&rdquo; said Bessie;
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like your
&lsquo;precedence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to feel relieved at his not taking it solemnly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> precedence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s yours&mdash;just exactly yours; and I
think it&rsquo;s odious,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a young lady for discussing
things!&nbsp; Has some one had the impudence to go before
you?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the going before me I object to,&rdquo;
said Bessie; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s their pretending they&rsquo;ve a
right to do it&mdash;a right I should grovellingly
recognise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a person, either, for not
&lsquo;recognising,&rsquo; let alone for not
&lsquo;grovelling.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every one here has to grovel to
somebody or to something&mdash;and no doubt it&rsquo;s all
beastly.&nbsp; But one takes the thick with the thin, and it
saves a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>makes</i> a lot of trouble, by which I mean a lot
of ugliness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s horrid!&rdquo; Bessie
maintained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how would you have the first people go?&rdquo; the
young man asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t go last, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean by the first people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if you mean to question first principles!&rdquo;
said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those are your first principles no wonder some of
your arrangements are horrid!&rdquo; she cried, with a charming
but not wholly sincere ferocity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a silly
chit, no doubt, so of course I go last; but imagine what Kitty
must feel on being informed that she&rsquo;s not at liberty to
budge till certain other ladies have passed out!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>&ldquo;Oh I say, she&rsquo;s not
&lsquo;informed&rsquo;!&rdquo; he protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one
would do such a thing as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s made to feel it&mdash;as if they were
afraid she&rsquo;d make a rush for the door.&nbsp; No,
you&rsquo;ve a lovely country&rdquo;&mdash;she clung as for
consistency to her discrimination&mdash;&ldquo;but your
precedence is horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t think your sister would
like it,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth said, with even exaggerated
gravity.&nbsp; But she couldn&rsquo;t induce him&mdash;amused as
he almost always was at the effect of giving her, as he called
it, her head&mdash;to join her in more formal reprobation of this
repulsive custom, which he spoke of as a convenience she would
destroy without offering a better in its place.</p>
<h3><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>VI</h3>
<p>Percy Beaumont had all this time been a very much less
frequent visitor at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel than his former fellow
traveller; he had in fact called but twice on the two American
ladies.&nbsp; Lord Lambeth, who often saw him, reproached him
with his neglect and declared that though Mrs. Westgate had said
nothing about it he made no doubt she was secretly wounded by
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;She suffers too much to speak,&rdquo; said his
comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all gammon,&rdquo; Percy returned;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a limit to what people can
suffer!&rdquo;&nbsp; And though sending no apologies to
Jones&rsquo;s Hotel he undertook in a manner to explain his
absence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always there yourself,
confound you, and that&rsquo;s reason enough for my not
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough for
both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care to be a witness of your
reckless passion,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.</p>
<p>His friend turned on him a cold eye and for a moment said
nothing, presently, however, speaking a little stiffly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My passion doesn&rsquo;t make such a show as you might
suppose, considering what a demonstrative beggar I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about
it&mdash;anything whatever,&rdquo; said Beaumont.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your mother asks me every time she sees me whether I
believe you&rsquo;re really lost&mdash;and Lady Pimlico does the
same.&nbsp; I prefer to be able to answer that I&rsquo;m in
complete <a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>ignorance, that I never go there.&nbsp; I stay away for
consistency&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; As I said the other day, they
must look after you themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re wonderfully considerate,&rdquo; the
young man returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;They never question
<i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid of you.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re afraid
of annoying you and making you worse.&nbsp; So they go to work
very cautiously, and, somewhere or other, they get their
information.&nbsp; They know a great deal about you.&nbsp; They
know you&rsquo;ve been with those ladies to the dome of Saint
Paul&rsquo;s and&mdash;where was the other place?&mdash;to the
Thames Tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all their knowledge is as accurate as that it must
be very valuable,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, they know you&rsquo;ve been visiting
the &lsquo;sights of the metropolis.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
think&mdash;very naturally, as it seems to me&mdash;that when you
take to visiting the sights of the metropolis with a little
nobody of an American girl something may be supposed to be
&lsquo;up.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man met this remark with
scornful laughter, but his companion continued after a pause:
&ldquo;I told you just now that I cultivate my ignorance, but I
find I can no longer stand my suspense.&nbsp; I confess I do want
to know whether you propose to marry Miss Alden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this point Lord Lambeth gave his questioner no prompt
satisfaction; he only mused&mdash;frowningly, portentously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By Jove they go rather too far.&nbsp; They <i>shall</i>
have cause to worry&mdash;I promise them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Beaumont, however, continued to aim at lucidity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s true, quite redeem your
threats.&nbsp; You said the other day you&rsquo;d make your
mother call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth just hung fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I asked her
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she declined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she shall do it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Percy, &ldquo;if she
gets much more scared I verily believe she will.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
friend watched him on this, and he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go to the girl herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean &lsquo;go&rsquo; to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll try to get &lsquo;at&rsquo; her&mdash;to
square her.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t care what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth turned away in silence; he took twenty steps and
slowly returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;She had better take care what she
does.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve invited Mrs. Westgate and Miss Alden to
Branches, and this evening I shall name a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you invite your mother and your sisters to
meet them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth indulged in one of his rare
discriminations.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall give them the
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will touch the Duchess up,&rdquo; said Percy
Beaumont.&nbsp; &ldquo;I &lsquo;guess&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may do as she pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you really propose to marry the little
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the way you talk about it!&rdquo; the young man
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t gobble me down.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t leave you on your knees,&rdquo; Percy
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the
inducement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk about proposing&mdash;wait till I <i>have</i>
proposed,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth went on.</p>
<p>His friend looked at him harder.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right, my dear chap.&nbsp; Think of <i>all</i> the
bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a charming girl,&rdquo; pursued his
lordship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s a charming girl.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know a girl more charming&mdash;in a very quiet
way.&nbsp; But there are other charming girls&mdash;charming in
all sorts of ways&mdash;nearer home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I particularly like her spirit,&rdquo; said
Bessie&rsquo;s admirer&mdash;almost as on a policy of
aggravation.</p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the peculiarity of her
spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not afraid, and she says things out and
thinks herself as good as any one.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the only
girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth explained,
&ldquo;who hasn&rsquo;t seemed to me dying to marry
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaumont considered it.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you know she
isn&rsquo;t dying if you haven&rsquo;t felt her pulse?&nbsp; I
mean if you haven&rsquo;t asked her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how; but I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she asked <i>me</i>&mdash;over
there&mdash;questions enough about your property and your
titles,&rdquo; Percy declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has done that to me too&mdash;again and
again,&rdquo; his friend returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she wants to
know about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything?&nbsp; Ah, I&rsquo;ll warrant she wants to
know.&nbsp; Depend upon it she&rsquo;s dying to marry you just as
much, and just by the same law, as all the rest of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared to give the young man, for a moment, something
rather special to think of.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like
her to refuse me&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the thing would be so disagreeable then, both to you
and to her, in heaven&rsquo;s name leave it alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such was the moral drawn by Mr. Beaumont; which left him
practically the last word in the discussion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate, on her side, had plenty to say to her sister
about the rarity of the latter&rsquo;s visits and the
non-appearance at their own door of the Duchess of
Bayswater.&nbsp; She confessed, however, to taking more pleasure
in this hush of symptoms than she could have taken in the most
lavish attentions on the part of that great lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unmistakable,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;delightfully unmistakable; a most interesting sign that
we&rsquo;ve made them wretched.&nbsp; The day we dined with him I
was really sorry for the poor boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will have been
<a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>gathered
that the entertainment offered by Lord Lambeth to his American
friends had been graced by the presence of no near
relation.&nbsp; He had invited several choice spirits to meet
them, but the ladies of his immediate family were to Mrs.
Westgate&rsquo;s sense&mdash;a sense perhaps morbidly
acute&mdash;conspicuous by their hostile absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work you up any further,&rdquo;
Bessie at last ventured to remark, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know
why you should have so many theories about Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s
poor mother.&nbsp; You know a great many young men in New York
without knowing their mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate rested deep eyes on her sister and then turned
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Bessie, you&rsquo;re
superb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s certain&rdquo;&mdash;the girl
continued not to blench at her irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I believed
I were a cause of annoyance, however unwitting, to Lord
Lambeth&rsquo;s family I should insist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insist on my leaving England?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that.&nbsp; I want to go to the National
Gallery again; I want to see Stratford-on-Avon and Canterbury
Cathedral.&nbsp; But I should insist on his ceasing relations
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very modest and very pretty of
you&mdash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t do it at this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;at this point&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Bessie asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I ceased to be modest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You care for him too much.&nbsp; A month ago, when you
said you didn&rsquo;t, I believe it was quite true.&nbsp; But at
present, my dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;you
wouldn&rsquo;t find it quite so simple a matter never to see Lord
Lambeth again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve watched it come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; Bessie declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>&ldquo;Ah, you poor proud thing, don&rsquo;t be
perverse!&rdquo; her companion returned.</p>
<p>The girl gave the matter, thus admonished, some visible
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know him better certainly, if you mean
that.&nbsp; And I like him very much.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
like him enough to make trouble for him with his family.&nbsp;
However, I don&rsquo;t believe in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the way you say &lsquo;however&rsquo;!&rdquo;
Mrs. Westgate commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you pretend you
wouldn&rsquo;t be glad to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Bessie calmly considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would take a
great deal more than is at all imaginable to make me marry
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her relative showed an impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what&rsquo;s the great difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great difficulty is that I shouldn&rsquo;t care
to,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden.</p>
<p>The morning after Lord Lambeth had had with his own frankest
critic that exchange of ideas which has just been narrated, the
ladies at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel received from him a written
invitation to pay their projected visit to Branches Castle on the
following Tuesday.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve made up a very
pleasant party,&rdquo; his lordship went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Several
people whom you know, and my mother and sisters, who have been
accidentally prevented from making your acquaintance
sooner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bessie at this lost no time in calling her
sister&rsquo;s attention to the injustice she had done the
Duchess of Bayswater, whose hostility was now proved to be a vain
illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see if she comes,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if she&rsquo;s to meet us at her
son&rsquo;s house the obligation&rsquo;s all the greater for her
to call on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie hadn&rsquo;t to wait long, for it appeared that her
friend&rsquo;s parent now descried the direction in which,
according to her companion&rsquo;s observation, courtesy
pointed.&nbsp; On the morrow, early in the afternoon, two <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>cards were
brought to the apartment of the American ladies&mdash;one of them
bearing the name of the Duchess of Bayswater and the other that
of the Countess of Pimlico.&nbsp; Mrs. Westgate glanced at the
clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t yet four,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve come early; they want really to find
us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she gave
orders that her visitors should be admitted.&nbsp; A few moments
later they were introduced and a solemn exchange of amenities
took place.&nbsp; The Duchess was a large lady with a fine fresh
colour; the Countess of Pimlico was very pretty and elegant.</p>
<p>The Duchess looked about her as she sat down&mdash;looked not
especially at Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay my son has
told you that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to come to see you,&rdquo;
she dropped&mdash;and from no towering nor inconvenient
height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate
vaguely&mdash;her conscience not allowing her to assent to this
proposition, and indeed not permitting her to enunciate her own
with any appreciable emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tells us you were so kind to him in America,&rdquo;
said the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very glad,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate replied,
&ldquo;to have been able to make him feel a little more&mdash;a
little less&mdash;a little at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he stayed at your house,&rdquo; the visitor
more heavily breathed, but as an overture, across to Bessie
Alden.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate intercepted the remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very
short time indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Duchess; and she continued to
address her interest to Bessie, who was engaged in conversation
with her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like London?&rdquo; Lady Pimlico had asked of
Bessie, after looking at her a good deal&mdash;at her face and
her hands, her dress and her hair.</p>
<p><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>The
girl was prompt and clear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very much
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like this hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like stopping at hotels?&rdquo; Lady Pimlico
asked after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of travelling, and I suppose hotels
are a necessary part of it.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re not the part
I&rsquo;m fondest of,&rdquo; Bessie without difficulty
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I hate travelling!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s
sister, who transferred her attention to Mrs. Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son tells me you&rsquo;re going to Branches,&rdquo;
the Duchess presently resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lambeth has been so good as to ask us,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Westgate, who felt herself now under the eyes of both
visitors and who had her customary happy consciousness of a
distinguished appearance.&nbsp; The only mitigation of her
felicity on this point was that, having taken in every item of
that of the Duchess, she said to herself: &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t
know how well I&rsquo;m dressed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been so good as to tell me he expects me, but
I&rsquo;m not quite sure of what I can do,&rdquo; the noble lady
exhaled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had offered us the p&mdash;the prospect of meeting
you,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate further contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the country at this season,&rdquo; the Duchess
went on.</p>
<p>Her hostess melted to sweetness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I delight in it
at all seasons.&nbsp; And I think it now above all pleasanter
than London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Duchess&rsquo;s eyes were absent again; she was
looking very fixedly at Bessie.&nbsp; In a minute she slowly
rose, passed across the room with a great rustle and an effect of
momentous displacement, reached a chair that stood empty at the
girl&rsquo;s right hand and <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>silently seated herself.&nbsp; As
she was a majestic voluminous woman this little transaction had
inevitably an air of somewhat impressive intention.&nbsp; It
diffused a certain awkwardness, which Lady Pimlico, as a
sympathetic daughter, perhaps desired to rectify in turning to
Mrs. Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you go out
immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, very little.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re strangers, and we
didn&rsquo;t come for the local society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lady Pimlico.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather nice in town just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known it of course duskier and
dingier.&nbsp; But we only go to see a few people,&rdquo; Mrs.
Westgate added&mdash;&ldquo;old friends or persons we
particularly like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course one can&rsquo;t like every one,&rdquo; Lady
Pimlico conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on one&rsquo;s society,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
returned.</p>
<p>The Duchess meanwhile had addressed herself to Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My son tells me the young ladies in America are so
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they made so good an impression on
him,&rdquo; our heroine smiled.</p>
<p>The Duchess took the case, clearly, as no matter for
grimacing; there reigned in her large pink face a meridian
calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very susceptible.&nbsp; He thinks
every one clever&mdash;and sometimes they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Bessie cheerfully assented.</p>
<p>The Duchess continued all serenely and publicly to appraise
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lambeth&rsquo;s very susceptible, but
he&rsquo;s very volatile too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Volatile?&rdquo; Bessie echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very inconstant.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t do to
depend on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the girl returned, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
recognise that description.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve depended on him
greatly, my <a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>sister and I, and have found him so faithful.&nbsp; He
has never disappointed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll disappoint you yet,&rdquo; said her Grace
with a certain rich force.</p>
<p>Bessie gave a laugh of amusement as at such a contention from
such a quarter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose it will depend on what we
expect of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less you expect the better,&rdquo; said her massive
monitress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we expect nothing unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duchess had a fine contemplative pause&mdash;evidently
with more to say.&nbsp; She made, in the quantity, her next
selection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lambeth says he has seen so much of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been with us very often&mdash;he has been a
ministering angel,&rdquo; Bessie hastened to put on record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re used to that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
told there&rsquo;s a great deal of that in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal of angelic ministering?&rdquo; the girl
laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you call it?&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;ve
different expressions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly don&rsquo;t always understand each
other,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, the termination of whose
interview with Lady Pimlico had allowed her to revert to their
elder visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking of the young men calling so much on
the young ladies,&rdquo; the Duchess explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely in England,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate appealed,
&ldquo;the young ladies don&rsquo;t call on the young
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them do&mdash;almost!&rdquo; Lady Pimlico
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a young man&rsquo;s a great
<i>parti</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessie, you must make a note of that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister&rdquo;&mdash;she gave their
friends the benefit of the knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;is a model
traveller.&nbsp; She writes down all the curious facts she hears
in a little book she keeps for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>The
Duchess took it, with a noble art of her own, as if she
hadn&rsquo;t heard it; and while she was so occupied&mdash;for
this involved a large deliberation&mdash;her daughter turned to
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother has told us of your being so
clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should have said my sister,&rdquo; Bessie
returned&mdash;&ldquo;when she treats you to such flights as
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you be long at Branches?&rdquo; the Duchess
abruptly asked of her.</p>
<p>Bessie was to have afterwards a vivid remembrance of wondering
what her Grace (she was so glad Duchesses had that predicate)
would mean by &ldquo;long.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she might as well
somehow have wondered what the occupants of the planet Mars
would.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has invited us for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must really manage it,&rdquo; the Duchess
declared&mdash;&ldquo;and my daughter too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be charming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall expect to see a deal of you,&rdquo; the Duchess
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I go to Branches I monopolise my
son&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must give themselves up to you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Westgate all graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite yearn to see it&mdash;to see the Castle,&rdquo;
Bessie went on to the larger lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
seen one&mdash;in England at least; and you know we&rsquo;ve none
in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re fond of castles?&rdquo;&mdash;her
Grace quite took it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the idea of them&mdash;which is all I
know&mdash;immensely.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the girl&rsquo;s pale
light deepened for the assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been the
dream of my life to live in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duchess looked at her as if hardly knowing how to take
such words, which, from the ducal point of view, had either to be
very artless or very <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>aggressive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
Branches myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And upon this the noble ladies took
their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they mean by it?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate sought
to know when they had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They meant to do the friendly thing,&rdquo; Bessie
surmised, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;re going to meet
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to do the friendly thing,&rdquo;
Mrs. Westgate replied almost grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They meant to
overawe us by their fine manners and their grandeur; they meant
to make you <i>l&acirc;cher prise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>L&acirc;cher prise</i>?&nbsp; What strange things
you say!&rdquo; the girl sighed as fairly for pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They meant to snub us so that we shouldn&rsquo;t dare
to go to Branches,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate substituted with
confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;the Duchess
offered to show me the place herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may depend upon it she won&rsquo;t let you out
of her sight.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll show you the place from morning
till night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a theory for everything,&rdquo; our young
woman a little more helplessly allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you apparently have none for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw no attempt to &lsquo;overawe&rsquo; us,&rdquo;
Bessie nevertheless persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their manners
weren&rsquo;t fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not even good!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
declared.</p>
<p>Her sister had a pause, but in a few moments claimed the
possession of an excellent theory.&nbsp; &ldquo;They just came to
look at me!&rdquo; she brought out as with much ingenuity.&nbsp;
Mrs. Westgate did the idea justice; she greeted it with a smile
and pronounced it a credit to a fresh young mind; while in
reality she felt that the girl&rsquo;s scepticism, or her
charity, or, as she had sometimes called it appropriately, her
idealism, was <a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>proof against irony.&nbsp; Bessie, however, remained
meditative all the rest of that day and well on into the
morrow.&nbsp; She privately ached&mdash;almost as under a
dishonour&mdash;with the aftersense of having been inspected in
that particular way.</p>
<p>On the morrow before luncheon Mrs. Westgate, having occasion
to go out for an hour, left her sister writing a letter.&nbsp;
When she came back she met Lord Lambeth at the door of the hotel
and in the act of leaving it.&nbsp; She thought he looked
considerably embarrassed; he certainly, she said to herself, had
no spring.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have missed you.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you come back?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen your
sister.&nbsp; I can never come back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he looked
at her a moment and took her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, Mrs.
Westgate&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been very kind to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And with what she thought a strange sad air on his handsome young
face he turned away.</p>
<p>She went in only to find Bessie still writing her letter; find
her, that is, seated at the table with the arrested pen in her
hand.&nbsp; She put her question after a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lord Lambeth has been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bessie got up and showed her a pale serious
face&mdash;bending it on her for some time, confessing silently
and, a little, pleading.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; the girl
said at last, &ldquo;that we couldn&rsquo;t go to
Branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Westgate gave a gasp of temporary disappointment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He might have waited,&rdquo; she nevertheless smiled,
&ldquo;till one had seen the Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; An hour
afterwards she spoke again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do wish, you know, you
might have accepted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bessie, with the slowest
gravest gentlest of headshakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really such a dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bessie repeated.</p>
<p><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only,&rdquo; her sister added,
&ldquo;because those women will think they succeeded&mdash;that
they paralysed us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young lady turned away, but presently added: &ldquo;They
were interesting.&nbsp; I should have liked to see them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate, with much
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should have liked to see the Castle,&rdquo; said
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;But now we must leave England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her sister&rsquo;s eyes studied her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t wait to go to the National Gallery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to Canterbury Cathedral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie lost herself for a little in this.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can
stop there on our way to Paris,&rdquo; she then said.</p>
<p>Lord Lambeth didn&rsquo;t tell Percy Beaumont that the
contingency he was not prepared at all to like had occurred; but
that gentleman, on hearing that the two ladies had left London,
wondered with some intensity what had happened; wondered, that
is, till the Duchess of Bayswater came a little to his
assistance.&nbsp; The two ladies went to Paris&mdash;when Mrs.
Westgate beguiled the journey by repeating several times:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I regret; they&rsquo;ll think they
petrified us.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Bessie Alden, strange and charming
girl, seemed to regret nothing.</p>
<h2><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>THE
PENSION BEAUREPAS</h2>
<h3><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>I</h3>
<p>I was not rich&mdash;on the contrary; and I had been told the
Pension Beaurepas was cheap.&nbsp; I had further been told that a
boarding-house is a capital place for the study of human
nature.&nbsp; I was inclined to a literary career and a friend
had said to me: &ldquo;If you mean to write you ought to go and
live in a boarding-house: there&rsquo;s no other such way to pick
up material.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had read something of this kind in a
letter addressed by the celebrated Stendhal to his sister:
&ldquo;I have a passionate desire to know human nature, and a
great mind to live in a boarding-house, where people can&rsquo;t
conceal their real characters.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was an admirer of
<i>La Chartreuse de Parme</i>, and easily believed one
couldn&rsquo;t do better than follow in the footsteps of its
author.&nbsp; I remembered, too, the magnificent boarding-house
in Balzac&rsquo;s <i>P&egrave;re Goriot</i>&mdash;the
&ldquo;pension bourgeoise des deux sexes et autres,&rdquo; kept
by Madame Vauquer, n&eacute;e de Conflans.&nbsp; Magnificent, I
mean, as a piece of portraiture; the establishment, as an
establishment, was certainly sordid enough, and I hoped for
better things from the Pension Beaurepas.&nbsp; This institution
was one of the most esteemed in Geneva and, standing in a little
garden of its own not far from the lake, had a very homely
comfortable sociable aspect.&nbsp; The regular entrance was, as
one might say, at the back, which looked upon the street, or
rather upon a little <i>place</i> adorned, <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>like every
<i>place</i> in Geneva, great or small, with a generous cool
fountain.&nbsp; That approach was not prepossessing, for on
crossing the threshold you found yourself more or less in the
kitchen&mdash;amid the &ldquo;offices&rdquo; and struck with
their assault on your nostril.&nbsp; This, however, was no great
matter, for at the Pension Beaurepas things conformed frankly to
their nature and the whole mechanism lay bare.&nbsp; It was
rather primitive, the mechanism, but it worked in a friendly
homely regular way.&nbsp; Madame Beaurepas was an honest little
old woman&mdash;she was far advanced in life and had been keeping
a pension for more than forty years&mdash;whose only faults were
that she was slightly deaf, that she was fond of a surreptitious
pinch of snuff, and that, at the age of seventy-four, she wore
stacks of flowers in her cap.&nbsp; There was a legend in the
house that she wasn&rsquo;t so deaf as she pretended and that she
feigned this infirmity in order to possess herself of the secrets
of her lodgers.&nbsp; I never indeed subscribed to this theory,
convinced as I became that Madame Beaurepas had outlived the
period of indiscreet curiosity.&nbsp; She dealt with the present
and the future in the steady light of a long experience; she had
been having lodgers for nearly half a century and all her concern
with them was that they should pay their bills, fold their
napkins and make use of the doormat.&nbsp; She cared very little
for their secrets.&nbsp; &ldquo;J&rsquo;en ai vus de toutes les
couleurs,&rdquo; she said to me.&nbsp; She had quite ceased to
trouble about individuals; she cared only for types and clear
categories.&nbsp; Her large observation had made her acquainted
with a number of these and her mind become a complete collection
of &ldquo;heads.&rdquo;&nbsp; She flattered herself that she knew
at a glance where to pigeonhole a new-comer, and if she made
mistakes her deportment never betrayed them.&nbsp; I felt that as
regards particular persons&mdash;once they conformed to the few
rules&mdash;she had neither likes <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>nor dislikes; but she was capable of
expressing esteem or contempt for a species.&nbsp; She had her
own ways, I suppose, of manifesting her approval, but her manner
of indicating the reverse was simple and unvarying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Je trouve que c&rsquo;est
d&eacute;plac&eacute;!&rdquo;&mdash;this exhausted her view of
the matter.&nbsp; If one of her inmates had put arsenic into the
<i>pot-au-feu</i> I believe Madame Beaurepas would have been
satisfied to remark that this receptacle was not the place for
arsenic.&nbsp; She could have imagined it otherwise and suitably
applied.&nbsp; The line of misconduct to which she most objected
was an undue assumption of gentility; she had no patience with
boarders who gave themselves airs.&nbsp; &ldquo;When people come
chez moi it isn&rsquo;t to cut a figure in the world; I&rsquo;ve
never so flattered myself,&rdquo; I remember hearing her say;
&ldquo;and when you pay seven francs a day, tout compris, it
comprises everything but the right to look down on the
others.&nbsp; Yet there are people who, the less they pay, take
themselves the more au s&eacute;rieux.&nbsp; My most difficult
boarders have always been those who&rsquo;ve fiercely bargained
and had the cheapest rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Beaurepas had a niece, a young woman of some forty odd
years; and the two ladies, with the assistance of a couple of
thick-waisted red-armed peasant-women, kept the house
going.&nbsp; If on your exits and entrances you peeped into the
kitchen it made very little difference; as C&eacute;lestine the
cook shrouded herself in no mystery and announced the day&rsquo;s
fare, amid her fumes, quite with the resonance of the priestess
of the tripod foretelling the future.&nbsp; She was always at
your service with a grateful grin: she blacked your boots; she
trudged off to fetch a cab; she would have carried your baggage,
if you had allowed her, on her broad little back.&nbsp; She was
always tramping in and out between her kitchen and the fountain
in the <i>place</i>, where it often seemed to me <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>that a
large part of the preparation for our meals went
forward&mdash;the wringing-out of towels and table-cloths, the
washing of potatoes and cabbages, the scouring of saucepans and
cleansing of water-bottles.&nbsp; You enjoyed from the door-step
a perpetual back-view of C&eacute;lestine and of her large loose
woollen ankles as she craned, from the waist, over into the
fountain and dabbled in her various utensils.&nbsp; This sounds
as if life proceeded but in a makeshift fashion at the Pension
Beaurepas&mdash;as if we suffered from a sordid tone.&nbsp; But
such was not at all the case.&nbsp; We were simply very
bourgeois; we practised the good old Genevese principle of not
sacrificing to appearances.&nbsp; Nothing can be better than that
principle when the rich real underlies it.&nbsp; We had the rich
real at the Pension Beaurepas: we had it in the shape of soft
short beds equipped with fluffy <i>duvets</i>; of admirable
coffee, served to us in the morning by C&eacute;lestine in person
as we lay recumbent on these downy couches; of copious wholesome
succulent dinners, conformable to the best provincial
traditions.&nbsp; For myself, I thought the Pension Beaurepas
local colour, and this, with me, at that time, was a grand
term.&nbsp; I was young and ingenuous and had just come from
America.&nbsp; I wished to perfect myself in the French tongue
and innocently believed it to flourish by Lake Leman.&nbsp; I
used to go to lectures at the Academy, the nursing mother of the
present University, and come home with a violent appetite.&nbsp;
I always enjoyed my morning walk across the long
bridge&mdash;there was only one just there in those
days&mdash;which spans the deep blue out-gush of the lake, and up
the dark steep streets of the old Calvinistic city.&nbsp; The
garden faced this way, toward the lake and the old town, and gave
properest access to the house.&nbsp; There was a high wall with a
double gate in the middle and flanked by a couple of ancient
massive posts; the big rusty grille <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>bristled with old-fashioned
iron-work.&nbsp; The garden was rather mouldy and weedy, tangled
and untended; but it contained a small thin-flowing fountain,
several green benches, a rickety little table of the same
complexion, together with three orange-trees in tubs disposed as
effectively as possible in front of the windows of the salon.</p>
<h3><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>II</h3>
<p>As commonly happens in boarding-houses the rustle of
petticoats was at the Pension Beaurepas the most familiar form of
the human tread.&nbsp; We enjoyed the usual allowance of
economical widows and old maids and, to maintain the balance of
the sexes, could boast but of a finished old Frenchman and an
obscure young American.&nbsp; It hardly made the matter easier
that the old Frenchman came from Lausanne.&nbsp; He was a native
of that well-perched place, but had once spent six months in
Paris, where he had tasted of the tree of knowledge; he had got
beyond Lausanne, whose resources he pronounced inadequate.&nbsp;
Lausanne, as he said, &ldquo;<i>manquait
d&rsquo;agr&ecirc;ments</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; When obliged, for
reasons he never specified, to bring his residence in Paris to a
close, he had fallen back on Geneva; he had broken his fall at
the Pension Beaurepas.&nbsp; Geneva was after all more like
Paris, and at a Genevese boarding-house there was sure to be
plenty of Americans who might be more or less counted on to add
to the resemblance.&nbsp; M. Pigeonneau was a little lean man
with a vast narrow nose, who sat a great deal in the garden and
bent his eyes, with the aid of a large magnifying glass, on a
volume from the <i>cabinet de lecture</i>.</p>
<p>One day a fortnight after my adoption of the retreat I
describe I came back rather earlier than usual from my academic
session; it wanted half an hour of the <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>midday
breakfast.&nbsp; I entered the salon with the design of
possessing myself of the day&rsquo;s <i>Galignani</i> before one
of the little English old maids should have removed it to her
virginal bower&mdash;a privilege to which Madame Beaurepas
frequently alluded as one of the attractions of the
establishment.&nbsp; In the salon I found a new-comer, a tall
gentleman in a high black hat, whom I immediately recognised as a
compatriot.&nbsp; I had often seen him, or his equivalent, in the
hotel-parlours of my native land.&nbsp; He apparently supposed
himself to be at the present moment in an hotel-parlour; his hat
was on his head or rather half off it&mdash;pushed back from his
forehead and more suspended than poised.&nbsp; He stood before a
table on which old newspapers were scattered; one of these he had
taken up and, with his eye-glass on his nose, was holding out at
arm&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; It was that honourable but extremely
diminutive sheet the <i>Journal de Gen&egrave;ve</i>, a newspaper
then of about the size of a pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; As I drew
near, looking for my <i>Galignani</i>, the tall gentleman gave
me, over the top of his eyeglass, a sad and solemn stare.&nbsp;
Presently, however, before I had time to lay my hand on the
object of my search, he silently offered me the <i>Journal de
Gen&egrave;ve</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be the paper of
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed at it again, still holding it at arm&rsquo;s-length
as if it had been a looking-glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
concluded, &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s natural a small country
should have small papers.&nbsp; You could wrap this one up,
mountains and all, in one of our dailies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found my <i>Galignani</i> and went off with it into the
garden, where I seated myself on a bench in the shade.&nbsp;
Presently I saw the tall gentleman in the hat appear at one of
the open windows of the salon and stand there with his hands in
his pockets and <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>his legs a little apart.&nbsp; He looked infinitely
bored, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;I immediately felt
sorry for him.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t at all&mdash;as M.
Pigeonneau, for instance, in his way, had it&mdash;the romantic
note; he looked just a jaded, faded, absolutely voided man of
business.&nbsp; But after a little he came into the garden and
began to stroll about; and then his restless helpless carriage
and the vague unacquainted manner in which his eyes wandered over
the place seemed to make it proper that, as an older resident, I
should offer him a certain hospitality.&nbsp; I addressed him
some remark founded on our passage of a moment before, and he
came and sat down beside me on my bench, clasping one of his long
knees in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is it this big breakfast of theirs comes
off?&rdquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call
it&mdash;the little breakfast and the big breakfast.&nbsp; I
never thought I should live to see the time when I&rsquo;d want
to eat two breakfasts.&nbsp; But a man&rsquo;s glad to do
anything over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself,&rdquo; I dropped, &ldquo;I find plenty to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head and glanced at me with an effect of
bottomless wonder and dry despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
getting used to the life, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the life very much,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you tried it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean anywhere.&nbsp; It seems to me pretty much
the same all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this house only a fortnight,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what should you say, from what you&rsquo;ve
seen?&rdquo; my companion asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you can see all there is at once.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet simplicity, eh?&nbsp; Well then I guess my two
ladies will know right off what&rsquo;s the matter with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh everything&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; I hastened to
<a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Madame Beaurepas is a
charming old woman.&nbsp; And then it&rsquo;s very
cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheap, is it?&rdquo; my friend languidly echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you so?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought
it possible he hadn&rsquo;t inquired the terms.&nbsp; But he
appeared not to have heard me; he sat there, clasping his knee
and absently blinking at the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from the United States, sir?&rdquo; he
presently demanded, turning his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I am, sir,&rdquo; I felt it indicated to
reply; and I mentioned the place of my nativity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presumed you were American or English.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m from the United States myself&mdash;from New York
City.&nbsp; Many of our people here?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so many as I believe there have sometimes
been.&nbsp; There are two or three ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; my interlocutor observed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
very fond of ladies&rsquo; society.&nbsp; I think when it&rsquo;s
really nice there&rsquo;s nothing comes up to it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got two ladies here myself.&nbsp; I must make you
acquainted with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then after I had rejoined
that I should be delighted and had inquired of him if he had been
long in Europe: &ldquo;Well, it seems precious long, but my
time&rsquo;s not up yet.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been here nineteen
weeks and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you travelling for pleasure?&rdquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>Once more he inclined his face to me&mdash;his face that was
practically so odd a comment on my question, and I so felt his
unspoken irony that I soon also turned and met his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Not much, sir,&rdquo; he added after a
considerable interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I said; for his desolation had a
little the effect of a rebuke.</p>
<p>He took no notice of my appeal; he simply continued to look at
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m travelling,&rdquo; he said at last,
&ldquo;to please the doctors.&nbsp; They seemed to think
<i>they&rsquo;d</i> enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>&ldquo;Ah, they sent you abroad for your
health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sent me abroad because they were so plaguey
muddled they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s often the best thing,&rdquo; I ventured to
remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a confession of medical bankruptcy; they wanted
to stop my run on them.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t know enough to
cure me, as they had originally pretended they did, and
that&rsquo;s the way they thought they&rsquo;d get round
it.&nbsp; I wanted to be cured&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want to be
transported.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t done any harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
could but assent to the general proposition of the inefficiency
of doctors, and put to my companion that I hoped he hadn&rsquo;t
been seriously ill.&nbsp; He only shook his foot at first, for
some time, by way of answer; but at last, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
get natural rest,&rdquo; he wearily observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very annoying.&nbsp; I suppose you
were overworked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a natural appetite&mdash;nor even
an unnatural, when they fixed up things for me.&nbsp; I took no
interest in my food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll both eat and sleep
here,&rdquo; I felt justified in remarking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hold a pen,&rdquo; my neighbour went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sit still.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t walk from my house to the cars&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s only a little way.&nbsp; I lost my interest in
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needed a good holiday,&rdquo; I concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the doctors said.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t so very smart of them.&nbsp; I had been paying
strict attention to business for twenty-three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in all that time you had never let up?&rdquo; I
cried in horror.</p>
<p>My companion waited a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;I kind o&rsquo; let
up Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;because our Sundays
themselves never let up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>&ldquo;I guess they do over here,&rdquo; said my
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you weren&rsquo;t over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t over here.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
have been where I was three years ago if I had spent my time
travelling round Europe.&nbsp; I was in a very advantageous
position.&nbsp; I did a very large business.&nbsp; I was
considerably interested in lumber.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused,
bending, though a little hopelessly, about to me again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you any business interests yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
answered that I had none, and he proceeded slowly, mildly and
deliberately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir, perhaps you&rsquo;re not
aware that business in the United States is not what it was a
short time since.&nbsp; Business interests are very
insecure.&nbsp; There seems to be a general falling-off.&nbsp;
Different parties offer different explanations of the fact, but
so far as I&rsquo;m aware none of their fine talk has set things
going again.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ingeniously intimated that if
business was dull the time was good for coming away; whereupon my
compatriot threw back his head and stretched his legs a
while.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir, that&rsquo;s one view of the
matter certainly.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something to be said for
that.&nbsp; These things should be looked at all round.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the ground my wife took.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
ground,&rdquo; he added in a moment, &ldquo;that a lady would
naturally take.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he added a laugh as ghostly
as a dried flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think there&rsquo;s a flaw in the reasoning?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, the ground I took was that the worse a
man&rsquo;s business is the more it requires looking after.&nbsp;
I shouldn&rsquo;t want to go out to recreation&mdash;not even to
go to church&mdash;if my house was on fire.&nbsp; My firm&rsquo;s
not doing the business it was; it&rsquo;s like a sick
child&mdash;it requires nursing.&nbsp; What I wanted the doctors
to do was to fix me up so that I could go on at home.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have taken anything they&rsquo;d have given me, and as
many times a day.&nbsp; I wanted to be right there; I had <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>my reasons;
I have them still.&nbsp; But I came off all the same,&rdquo; said
my friend with a melancholy smile.</p>
<p>I was a great deal younger than he, but there was something so
simple and communicative in his tone, so expressive of a desire
to fraternise and so exempt from any theory of human differences,
that I quite forgot his seniority and found myself offering him
paternal advice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about all
that.&nbsp; Simply enjoy yourself, amuse yourself, get
well.&nbsp; Travel about and see Europe.&nbsp; At the end of a
year, by the time you&rsquo;re ready to go home, things will have
improved over there, and you&rsquo;ll be quite well and
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my knee; his wan kind eyes considered me,
and I thought he was going to say &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
young!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he only brought out:
&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> got used to Europe anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>III</h3>
<p>At breakfast I encountered his ladies&mdash;his wife and
daughter.&nbsp; They were placed, however, at a distance from me,
and it was not until the pensionnaires had dispersed and some of
them, according to custom, had come out into the garden, that he
had an opportunity of carrying out his offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to introduce you to my
daughter?&rdquo; he said, moved apparently by a paternal
inclination to provide this young lady with social
diversion.&nbsp; She was standing with her mother in one of the
paths, where she looked about with no great complacency, I
inferred, at the homely characteristics of the place.&nbsp; Old
M. Pigeonneau meanwhile hovered near, hesitating apparently
between the desire to be urbane and the absence of a
pretext.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Ruck, Miss Sophy Ruck&rdquo;&mdash;my
friend led me up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruck was a ponderous light-coloured person with a smooth
fair face, a somnolent eye and an arrangement of hair, with
forehead-tendrils, water-waves and other complications, that
reminded me of those framed &ldquo;capillary&rdquo; tributes to
the dead which used long ago to hang over artless mantel-shelves
between the pair of glass domes protecting wax flowers.&nbsp;
Miss Sophy was a girl of one-and-twenty, tiny and pretty and
lively, with no more maiden shyness than a feminine terrier in a
tinkling collar.&nbsp; Both of these ladies were arrayed in black
silk dresses, <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>much ruffled and flounced, and if elegance were
<i>all</i> a matter of trimming they would have been elegant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think highly of this pension?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Ruck after a few preliminaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little rough,&rdquo; I made answer,
&ldquo;but it seems to me comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it take a high rank in Geneva?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine it enjoys a very fair fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never dream of comparing it to a New York
boarding-house,&rdquo; Mrs. Ruck pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite in a different style,&rdquo; her
daughter observed.&nbsp; Miss Ruck had folded her arms; she held
her elbows with a pair of small white hands and tapped the ground
with a pretty little foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hardly expected to come to a pension,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ruck, who looked considerably over my head and seemed to
confide the truth in question, as with an odd austerity or
chastity, a marked remoteness, to the general air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But we thought we&rsquo;d try; we had heard so much about
Swiss pensions.&nbsp; I was saying to Mr. Ruck that I wondered if
this is a favourable specimen.&nbsp; I was afraid we might have
made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know some people who have been here; they
think everything of Madame Beaurepas,&rdquo; said Miss
Sophy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say she&rsquo;s a real
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruck, at this, drew down a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. and
Mrs. Parker&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard her speak of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Beaurepas has had a great many Americans;
she&rsquo;s very fond of Americans,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say I should think she would be if she
compares them with some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s death on comparing,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I like to study things and to see for <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>myself,&rdquo; the elder lady returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never had a chance till now; I never knew my privileges.&nbsp;
Give me an American!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, recovering her distance
again, she seemed to impose this tax on the universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say there are some things I like over
here,&rdquo; said Miss Sophy with courage.&nbsp; And indeed I
could see that she was a young woman of sharp affirmations.</p>
<p>Her father gave one of his ghostly grunts.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
like the stores&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you like most, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady addressed herself to me without heeding this
charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you feel quite at home
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh he likes it&mdash;he has got used to the life.&nbsp;
He says you <i>can</i>!&rdquo; Mr. Ruck proclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d teach Mr. Ruck then,&rdquo; said his
wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems as if he couldn&rsquo;t get used to
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to you, my dear,&rdquo; he retorted, but
with his melancholy eyes on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s intensely restless,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what made me want to come to a
pension.&nbsp; I thought he&rsquo;d settle down more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lovey,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
hitherto mainly to settle up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In view of a possible clash between her parents I took refuge
in conversation with Miss Ruck, who struck me as well out in the
open&mdash;as leaning, subject to any swing, so to speak, on the
easy gate of the house of life.&nbsp; I learned from her that
with her companions, after a visit to the British islands, she
had been spending a month in Paris and that she thought she
should have died on quitting that city.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hung out
of the carriage, when we left the hotel&mdash;I assure you I
did.&nbsp; And I guess mother did, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the other window, I hope,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one out of each window&rdquo;&mdash;her
promptitude was perfect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father had hard work, I can
tell <a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>you.&nbsp; We hadn&rsquo;t half-finished&mdash;there
were ever so many other places we wanted to go to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father insisted on coming away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;after we had been there about a month he
claimed he had had enough.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s fearfully restless;
he&rsquo;s very much out of health.&nbsp; Mother and I took the
ground that if he was restless in Paris he needn&rsquo;t hope for
peace anywhere.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t mean to let up on him till
he takes us back.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an air of keen
resolution in Miss Ruck&rsquo;s pretty face, of the lucid
apprehension of desirable ends, which made me, as she pronounced
these words, direct a glance of covert compassion toward her poor
recalcitrant sire.&nbsp; He had walked away a little with his
wife, and I saw only his back and his stooping patient-looking
shoulders, whose air of acute resignation was thrown into relief
by the cold serenity of his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
have to take us back in September anyway,&rdquo; the girl
pursued; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have to take us back to get some
things we&rsquo;ve ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had an idea it was my duty to draw her out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you ordered a great many things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ve ordered <i>some</i>.&nbsp; Of
course we wanted to take advantage of being in Paris&mdash;ladies
always do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve left the most important ones till we
go back.&nbsp; Of course that&rsquo;s the principal interest for
ladies.&nbsp; Mother said she&rsquo;d feel so shabby if she just
passed through.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve promised all the people to be
right there in September, and I never broke a promise yet.&nbsp;
So Mr. Ruck has got to make his plans accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are his plans?&rdquo; I continued, true to my
high conception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; he doesn&rsquo;t seem able to make
any.&nbsp; His great idea was to get to Geneva, but now that he
has got here he doesn&rsquo;t seem to see the point.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the effect of bad health.&nbsp; He used to be so
bright and <a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>natural, but now he&rsquo;s quite subdued.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s about time he should improve, anyway.&nbsp; We went
out last night to look at the jewellers&rsquo; windows&mdash;in
that street behind the hotel.&nbsp; I had always heard of those
jewellers&rsquo; windows.&nbsp; We saw some lovely things, but it
didn&rsquo;t seem to rouse father.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get tired of
Geneva sooner than he did of Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are finer things here
than the jewellers&rsquo; windows.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re very near
some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean the mountains.&nbsp; Well, I guess
we&rsquo;ve seen plenty of mountains at home.&nbsp; We used to go
to the mountains every summer.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re familiar enough
with the mountains.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t we, mother?&rdquo; my
young woman demanded, appealing to Mrs. Ruck, who, with her
husband, had drawn near again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we what?&rdquo; inquired the elder
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we familiar with the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ruck.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck, with his hands in his pockets, gave me a sociable
wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much you can <i>tell</i>
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two ladies stood face to face a few moments, surveying
each other&rsquo;s garments.&nbsp; Then the girl put her mother a
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we&rsquo;d better.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got
to go up to that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what place?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that jeweller&rsquo;s&mdash;to that big
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all seemed big enough&mdash;they were <i>too</i>
big!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he gave me another dry wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one where we saw the blue cross,&rdquo; said his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come, what do you want of that blue cross?&rdquo;
poor Mr. Ruck demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to hang it on a black velvet ribbon and tie
it round her neck,&rdquo; said his wife.</p>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>&ldquo;A black velvet ribbon?&nbsp; Not much!&rdquo;
cried the young lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;d wear
that cross on a black velvet ribbon?&nbsp; On a nice little gold
chain, if you please&mdash;a little narrow gold chain like an
old-fashioned watch-chain.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the proper thing
for that blue cross.&nbsp; I know the sort of chain I mean;
I&rsquo;m going to look for one.&nbsp; When I want a
thing,&rdquo; said Miss Ruck with decision, &ldquo;I can
generally find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Sophy,&rdquo; her father urged, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t want that blue cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want it&mdash;I happen to want it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And her light laugh, with which she glanced at me, was like the
flutter of some gage of battle.</p>
<p>The grace of this demonstration, in itself marked, suggested
that there were various relations in which one might stand to
Miss Ruck; but I felt that the sharpest of the strain would come
on the paternal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry the poor
child,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>She took it sharply up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on,
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to look round a little,&rdquo; the
elder lady explained to me by way of taking leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what that means,&rdquo; their companion dropped
as they moved away.&nbsp; He stood looking at them while he
raised his hand to his head, behind, and rubbed it with a
movement that displaced his hat.&nbsp; (I may remark in
parenthesis that I never saw a hat more easily displaced than Mr.
Ruck&rsquo;s.)&nbsp; I supposed him about to exhale some plaint,
but I was mistaken.&nbsp; Mr. Ruck was unhappy, but he was a
touching fatalist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, they want to pick up
something,&rdquo; he contented himself with recognising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the principal interest for ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>IV</h3>
<p>He distinguished me, as the French say; he honoured me with
his esteem and, as the days elapsed, with no small share of his
confidence.&nbsp; Sometimes he bored me a little, for the tone of
his conversation was not cheerful, tending as it did almost
exclusively to a melancholy dirge over the financial prostration
of our common country.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir, business in the
United States is not what it once was,&rdquo; he found occasion
to remark several times a day.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not the
same spring&mdash;there&rsquo;s not the same hopeful
feeling.&nbsp; You can see it in all departments.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
used to sit by the hour in the little garden of the pension with
a roll of American newspapers in his lap and his high hat pushed
back, swinging one of his long legs and reading the <i>New York
Herald</i>.&nbsp; He paid a daily visit to the American
banker&rsquo;s on the other side of the Rh&ocirc;ne and remained
there a long time, turning over the old papers on the green
velvet table in the centre of the Salon des Etrangers and
fraternising with chance compatriots.&nbsp; But in spite of these
diversions the time was heavy on his hands.&nbsp; I used at times
to propose him a walk, but he had a mortal horror of any use of
his legs other than endlessly dangling or crossing them, and
regarded my direct employment of my own as a morbid form of
activity.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill yourself if you
don&rsquo;t look out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;walking all over the
country.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to stump round that way&mdash;I
ain&rsquo;t <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>a postman!&rdquo;&nbsp; Briefly speaking, Mr. Ruck had
few resources.&nbsp; His wife and daughter, on the other hand, it
was to be supposed, were possessed of a good many that
couldn&rsquo;t be apparent to an unobtrusive young man.&nbsp;
They also sat a great deal in the garden or in the salon, side by
side, with folded hands, taking in, to vague ends, material
objects, and were remarkably independent of most of the usual
feminine aids to idleness&mdash;light literature, tapestry, the
use of the piano.&nbsp; They lent themselves to complete
displacement, however, much more than their companion, and I
often met them, in the Rue du Rh&ocirc;ne and on the quays,
loitering in front of the jewellers&rsquo; windows.&nbsp; They
might have had a cavalier in the person of old M. Pigeonneau, who
professed a high appreciation of their charms, but who, owing to
the absence of a common idiom, was deprived, in the connexion, of
the pleasures of intimacy.&nbsp; He knew no English, and Mrs.
Ruck and her daughter had, as it seemed, an incurable mistrust of
the beautiful tongue which, as the old man endeavoured to impress
upon them, was pre-eminently the language of conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a tournure de princesse&mdash;a distinction
supr&ecirc;me,&rdquo; he said to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;One&rsquo;s
surprised to find them in a little pension bourgeoise at seven
francs a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh they don&rsquo;t come for economy.&nbsp; They must
be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t come for my beaux yeux&mdash;for
mine,&rdquo; said M. Pigeonneau sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
it&rsquo;s for yours, young man.&nbsp; Je vous recommande la
maman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;They came on account of
Mr. Ruck because at hotels he&rsquo;s so restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Pigeonneau gave me a knowing nod.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course he
is, with such a wife as that!&mdash;a femme superbe.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s preserved in perfection&mdash;a miraculous
fra&icirc;cheur.&nbsp; I like those large, fair, quiet women; <a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>they&rsquo;re often, dans l&rsquo;intimit&eacute;, the
most agreeable.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll warrant you that at heart Madame
Roque is a finished coquette.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as I
demurred: &ldquo;You suppose her cold?&nbsp; Ne vous y fiez
pas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter in which I&rsquo;ve nothing at
stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young Americans are droll,&rdquo; said M.
Pigeonneau; &ldquo;you never have anything at stake!&nbsp; But
the little one, for example; I&rsquo;ll warrant you she&rsquo;s
not cold.&nbsp; Toute menue as she is she&rsquo;s admirably
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s very pretty&rsquo;!&nbsp; Vous dites
cela d&rsquo;un ton!&nbsp; When you pay compliments to Mees Roque
I hope that&rsquo;s not the way you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pay compliments to Miss Ruck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, decidedly,&rdquo; said M. Pigeonneau, &ldquo;you
young Americans are droll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have suspected that these two ladies wouldn&rsquo;t
especially commend themselves to Madame Beaurepas; that as a
ma&icirc;tresse de salon, which she in some degree aspired to be,
she would have found them wanting in a certain colloquial
ease.&nbsp; But I should have gone quite wrong: Madame Beaurepas
had no fault at all to find with her new pensionnaires.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no observation whatever to make about
them,&rdquo; she said to me one evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see
nothing in those ladies at all d&eacute;plac&eacute;.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t complain of anything; they don&rsquo;t meddle; they
take what&rsquo;s given them; they leave me tranquil.&nbsp; The
Americans are often like that.&nbsp; Often, but not
always,&rdquo; Madame Beaurepas pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
to have a specimen to-morrow of a very different sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was duly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two Am&eacute;ricaines&mdash;a mother and a
daughter.&nbsp; There are Americans and Americans: when
you&rsquo;re difficiles you&rsquo;re more so than any one, and
when you&rsquo;ve pretensions&mdash;ah, par exemple, it&rsquo;s
serious.&nbsp; I foresee that with this little lady everything
will be <a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>serious, beginning with her caf&eacute; au lait.&nbsp;
She has been staying at the Pension Chamousset&mdash;my
concurrente, you know, further up the street; but she&rsquo;s
coming away because the coffee&rsquo;s bad.&nbsp; She holds to
her coffee, it appears.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what liquid
Madame Chamousset may dispense under that name, but we&rsquo;ll
do the best we can for her.&nbsp; Only I know she&rsquo;ll make
me des histoires about something else.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll demand
a new lamp for the salon; vous allez voir cela.&nbsp; She wishes
to pay but eleven francs a day for herself and her daughter, tout
compris; and for their eleven francs they expect to be lodged
like princesses.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s very
&lsquo;ladylike&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that what you call it in
English?&nbsp; Oh, pour cela, she&rsquo;s ladylike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse on the morrow of the source of these
portents, who had presented herself at our door as I came in from
a walk.&nbsp; She had come in a cab, with her daughter and her
luggage; and with an air of perfect softness and serenity she now
disputed the fare as she stood on the steps and among her
boxes.&nbsp; She addressed her cabman in a very English accent,
but with extreme precision and correctness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish
to be perfectly reasonable, but don&rsquo;t wish to encourage you
in exorbitant demands.&nbsp; With a franc and a half you&rsquo;re
sufficiently paid.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the custom at Geneva to
give a pourboire for so short a drive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made
inquiries and find it&rsquo;s not the custom even in the best
families.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a stranger, yes, but I always adopt the
custom of the native families.&nbsp; I think it my duty to the
natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a native too, moi!&rdquo; cried the
cabman in high derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to me to speak with a German accent,&rdquo;
continued the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably from
Basel.&nbsp; A franc and a half are sufficient.&nbsp; I see
you&rsquo;ve left behind the little red bag I asked you to hold
between your knees; you&rsquo;ll please to go back to the other
house <a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>and get it.&nbsp; Very well, si vous me manquez
I&rsquo;ll make a complaint of you to-morrow at the
administration.&nbsp; Aurora, you&rsquo;ll find a pencil in the
outer pocket of my embroidered satchel; please write down his
number&mdash;87; do you see it distinctly?&mdash;in case we
should forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady so addressed&mdash;a slight fair girl holding a
large parcel of umbrellas&mdash;stood at hand while this
allocution went forward, but apparently gave no heed to it.&nbsp;
She stood looking about her in a listless manner&mdash;looking at
the front of the house, at the corridor, at C&eacute;lestine
tucking back her apron in the doorway, at me as I passed in amid
the disseminated luggage; her mother&rsquo;s parsimonious
attitude seeming to produce in Miss Aurora neither sympathy nor
embarrassment.&nbsp; At dinner the two ladies were placed on the
same side of the table as myself and below Mrs. Ruck and her
daughter&mdash;my own position being on the right of Mr.
Ruck.&nbsp; I had therefore little observation of Mrs.
Church&mdash;such I learned to be her name&mdash;but I
occasionally heard her soft distinct voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White wine, if you please; we prefer white wine.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s none on the table?&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll please
get some and remember to place a bottle of it always here between
my daughter and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lady seems to know what she wants,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ruck, &ldquo;and she speaks so I can understand her.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t understand every one over here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like
to make that lady&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; Perhaps she knows
what <i>I</i> want, too: it seems so hard to find out!&nbsp; But
I don&rsquo;t want any of their sour white wine; that&rsquo;s one
of the things I don&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;ll be
an addition to the pension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck made the acquaintance of Mrs. Church that evening in
the parlour, being presented to her by his wife, who presumed on
the rights conferred <a name="page372"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 372</span>upon herself by the mutual
proximity, at table, of the two ladies.&nbsp; I seemed to make
out that in Mrs. Church&rsquo;s view Mrs. Ruck presumed too
far.&nbsp; The fugitive from the Pension Chamousset, as M.
Pigeonneau called her, was a little fresh plump comely woman,
looking less than her age, with a round bright serious
face.&nbsp; She was very simply and frugally dressed, not at all
in the manner of Mr. Ruck&rsquo;s companions, and had an air of
quiet distinction which was an excellent defensive weapon.&nbsp;
She exhibited a polite disposition to listen to what Mr. Ruck
might have to say, but her manner was equivalent to an intimation
that what she valued least in boarding-house life was its social
opportunities.&nbsp; She had placed herself near a lamp, after
carefully screwing it and turning it up, and she had opened in
her lap, with the assistance of a large embroidered marker, an
octavo volume which I perceived to be in German.&nbsp; To Mrs.
Ruck and her daughter she was evidently a puzzle; they were
mystified beyond appeal by her frugal attire and expensive
culture.&nbsp; The two younger ladies, however, had begun to
fraternise freely, and Miss Ruck presently went wandering out of
the room with her arm round the waist of Miss Church.&nbsp; It
was a warm evening; the long windows of the salon stood wide open
to the garden, and, inspired by the balmy darkness, M. Pigeonneau
and Mademoiselle Beaurepas, a most obliging little woman who
lisped and always wore a huge cravat, declared they would
organise a f&ecirc;te de nuit.&nbsp; They engaged in this
enterprise, and the f&ecirc;te developed itself on the lines of
half a dozen red paper lanterns hung about in the trees, and of
several glasses of <i>sirop</i> carried on a tray by the
stout-armed C&eacute;lestine.&nbsp; As the occasion deepened to
its climax I went out into the garden, where M. Pigeonneau was
master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are those charming young ladies,&rdquo; he <a
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>cried,
&ldquo;Mees Roque and the new-comer, l&rsquo;aimable
transfuge?&nbsp; Their absence has been remarked and
they&rsquo;re wanting to the brilliancy of the scene.&nbsp;
Voyez, I have selected a glass of syrup&mdash;a generous
glass&mdash;for Mees Roque, and I advise you, my young friend, if
you wish to make a good impression, to put aside one which you
may offer to the other young lady.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s her
name?&nbsp; Mees Cheurche?&nbsp; I see; it&rsquo;s a singular
name.&nbsp; Ca veut dire &lsquo;&eacute;glise,&rsquo;
n&rsquo;est-ce-pas?&nbsp; Voil&agrave;, a church where I&rsquo;d
willingly worship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck presently came out of the salon, having concluded his
interview with the elder of the pair.&nbsp; Through the open
window I saw that accomplished woman seated under the lamp with
her German octavo, while Mrs. Ruck, established empty-handed in
an armchair near her, fairly glowered at her for fascination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I told you she&rsquo;d know what I want,&rdquo;
he promptly observed to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;She says I want to go
right up to Appenzell, wherever that is; that I want to drink
whey and live in a high latitude&mdash;what did she call
it?&mdash;a high altitude.&nbsp; She seemed to think we ought to
leave for Appenzell to-morrow; she&rsquo;d got it all
fixed.&nbsp; She says this ain&rsquo;t a high enough lat&mdash;a
high enough altitude.&nbsp; And she says I mustn&rsquo;t go too
high either; that would be just as bad; she seems to know just
the right figure.&nbsp; She says she&rsquo;ll give me a list of
the hotels where we must stop on the way to Appenzell.&nbsp; I
asked her if she didn&rsquo;t want to go with us, but she says
she&rsquo;d rather sit still and read.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;s
a big reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter of this devotee now reappeared, in company with
Miss Ruck, with whom she had been strolling through the outlying
parts of the garden; and that young lady noted with interest the
red paper lanterns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; she
inquired, &ldquo;are they trying to stick the flower-pots into
the trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an illumination in honour of our
arrival,&rdquo; her companion returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
triumph over Madame Chamousset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, at the Pension Chamousset,&rdquo; I ventured
to suggest, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve put out their
lights&mdash;they&rsquo;re sitting in darkness and lamenting your
departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at me&mdash;she was standing in the light that came
from the house.&nbsp; M. Pigeonneau meanwhile, who had awaited
his chance, advanced to Miss Ruck with his glass of syrup.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept it for you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jealously guarded it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ruck looked at him and his syrup without making any
motion to take the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s
sour,&rdquo; she dropped with a small shake of her head.</p>
<p>M. Pigeonneau stood staring, his syrup in his hand; then he
slowly turned away.&nbsp; He looked about at the rest of us as to
appeal from Miss Ruck&rsquo;s insensibility, and went to deposit
his rejected tribute on a bench.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
give it to me?&rdquo; asked Miss Church in faultless
French.&nbsp; &ldquo;J&rsquo;adore le sirop, moi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Pigeonneau came back with alacrity and presented the glass
with a very low bow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I adore good
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This incident caused me to look at Miss Church with quickened
interest.&nbsp; She was not strikingly pretty, but in her
charming irregular face was a light of ardour.&nbsp; Like her
mother, though in a less degree, she was simply dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to go to America, and her mother won&rsquo;t
let her&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Sophy explained to me her
friend&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;for America,&rdquo; I
responsively laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to say anything against your
<a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>mother,
but I think it&rsquo;s shameful,&rdquo; Miss Ruck pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma has very good reasons.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll tell
you them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to hear
them,&rdquo; said Miss Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a
right to your own country; every one has a right to their own
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s not very patriotic,&rdquo; Aurora was at
any rate not too spiritless to mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I call that dreadful,&rdquo; her companion
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there are some Americans
like that, but I never believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there are all sorts of Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aurora&rsquo;s one of the right sort,&rdquo; cried Miss
Ruck, ready, it seemed, for the closest comradeship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very patriotic,&rdquo; I asked of the
attractive exile.</p>
<p>Miss Ruck, however, promptly answered for her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right down homesick&mdash;she&rsquo;s dying to
go.&nbsp; If you were me,&rdquo; she went on to her friend,
&ldquo;I guess your mother would <i>have</i> to take
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s going to take me to Dresden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard of anything so cold-blooded!&rdquo;
said Miss Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like something in a weird
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard Dresden was so awful a fate,&rdquo; I
ventured to interpose.</p>
<p>Miss Ruck&rsquo;s eyes made light of me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t believe <i>you</i>&rsquo;re a good American,&rdquo;
she smartly said, &ldquo;and I never supposed you were.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d better go right in there and talk to Mrs.
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dresden&rsquo;s really very nice, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; I asked of her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nice if you happen to prefer New
York,&rdquo; Miss Ruck at once returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Church
prefers New York.&nbsp; Tell him you&rsquo;re dying to see New
York; it will make him mad,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no desire to make him mad,&rdquo;
Aurora smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Miss Ruck who can do that,&rdquo; I
hastened to state.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been a long time in
Europe?&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that wicked!&rdquo; Miss Ruck declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be in a worse place,&rdquo; I
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find Europe very
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ruck fairly snorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just
<i>saying</i> that you wanted to pass for a European.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I saw my way to admit it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I want to
pass for a Dalmatian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ruck pounced straight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you had better
not come home.&nbsp; We know how to treat your sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you born in these countries?&rdquo; I asked of
Aurora Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;I came to Europe a small child.&nbsp; But I
remember America a little, and it seems delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see it again.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just too
lovely,&rdquo; said Miss Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grandest country in all the world,&rdquo; I
added.</p>
<p>Miss Ruck began to toss her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away, my
dear.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s a creature I despise it&rsquo;s a
man who tries to say funny things about his own
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Aurora lingered while she all appealingly put it to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think one can be tired of
Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;as one may be tired of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired of the life?&rdquo; cried Miss Ruck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Father was tired of it after three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here sixteen years,&rdquo; her friend
went on, looking at me as for some charming intelligence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It <a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>used to be for my education.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what it&rsquo;s for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautifully educated,&rdquo; Miss Ruck
guaranteed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She knows four languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very sure I know English!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should go to Boston!&rdquo; said our
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;They speak splendidly in
Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est mon r&ecirc;ve,&rdquo; said Aurora, still
looking at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been all over Europe,&rdquo;
I asked&mdash;&ldquo;in all the different countries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She consulted her reminiscences.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everywhere you
can find a pension.&nbsp; Mamma&rsquo;s devoted to
pensions.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve lived at one time or another in every
pension in Europe&mdash;say at some five or six
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think you had seen about enough!&rdquo;
Miss Ruck exhaled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a delightful way of seeing
Europe&rdquo;&mdash;our friend rose to a bright high irony.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may imagine how it has attached me to the different
countries.&nbsp; I have such charming souvenirs!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a pension awaiting us now at Dresden&mdash;eight
francs a day, without wine.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so much beyond our
mark that mamma means to make them give us wine.&nbsp;
Mamma&rsquo;s a great authority on pensions; she&rsquo;s known,
that way, all over Europe.&nbsp; Last winter we were in Italy,
and she discovered one at Piacenza&mdash;four francs a day.&nbsp;
We made economies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t seem to mingle much,&rdquo;
observed Miss Ruck, who had glanced through the window at Mrs.
Church&rsquo;s concentration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t mingle, except in the native
society.&nbsp; Though she lives in pensions she detests our
vulgar life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vulgar&rsquo;?&rdquo; cried Miss Ruck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why then does she skimp so?&rdquo;&nbsp; This young woman
had clearly no other notion of vulgarity.</p>
<p><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>&ldquo;Oh because we&rsquo;re so poor; it&rsquo;s the
cheapest way to live.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve tried having a cook, but
the cook always steals.&nbsp; Mamma used to set me to watch her;
that&rsquo;s the way I passed my jeunesse&mdash;my belle
jeunesse.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re frightfully poor,&rdquo; she went on
with the same strange frankness&mdash;a curious mixture of
girlish grace and conscious cynicism.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nous
n&rsquo;avons pas le sou.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the reasons
we don&rsquo;t go back to America.&nbsp; Mamma says we could
never afford to live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, any one can see that you&rsquo;re an American
girl,&rdquo; Miss Ruck remarked in a consolatory manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can tell an American girl a mile off.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
got the natural American style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t the natural American
clothes,&rdquo; said Aurora in tribute to the other&rsquo;s
splendour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your dress was cut in France; any one can see
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; our young lady laughed, &ldquo;my dress was
cut in France&mdash;at Avranches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got a lovely figure anyway,&rdquo;
pursued her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said for the pleasantry of it, &ldquo;at
Avranches, too, my figure was admired.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
looked at me askance and with no clear poverty of
intention.&nbsp; But I was an innocent youth and I only looked
back at her and wondered.&nbsp; She was a great deal nicer than
Miss Ruck, and yet Miss Ruck wouldn&rsquo;t have said that in
that way.&nbsp; &ldquo;I try to be the American girl,&rdquo; she
continued; &ldquo;I do my best, though mamma doesn&rsquo;t at all
encourage it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very patriotic.&nbsp; I try to
strike for freedom, though mamma has brought me up &agrave; la
fran&ccedil;aise; that is as much as one can in pensions.&nbsp;
For instance I&rsquo;ve never been out of the house without
mamma&mdash;oh never never!&nbsp; But sometimes I despair;
American girls do come out so <a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>with things.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
come out, I can&rsquo;t rush in, like that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
awfully pinched, I&rsquo;m always afraid.&nbsp; But I do what I
can, as you see.&nbsp; Excusez du peu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought this young lady of an inspiration at least as
untrammelled as her unexpatriated sisters, and her despondency in
the true note of much of their predominant prattle.&nbsp; At the
same time she had by no means caught, as it seemed to me, what
Miss Ruck called the natural American style.&nbsp; Whatever her
style was, however, it had a fascination&mdash;I knew not what
(as I called it) distinction, and yet I knew not what odd
freedom.</p>
<p>The young ladies began to stroll about the garden again, and I
enjoyed their society until M. Pigeonneau&rsquo;s conception of a
&ldquo;high time&rdquo; began to languish.</p>
<h3><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>V</h3>
<p>Mr. Ruck failed to take his departure for Appenzell on the
morrow, in spite of the eagerness to see him off quaintly
attributed by him to Mrs. Church.&nbsp; He continued on the
contrary for many days after to hang about the garden, to wander
up to the banker&rsquo;s and back again, to engage in desultory
conversation with his fellow boarders, and to endeavour to
assuage his constitutional restlessness by perusal of the
American journals.&nbsp; But it was at least on the morrow that I
had the honour of making Mrs. Church&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp;
She came into the salon after the midday breakfast, her German
octavo under her arm, and appealed to me for assistance in
selecting a quiet corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you very kindly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;move
that large fauteuil a little more this way?&nbsp; Not the
largest; the one with the little cushion.&nbsp; The fauteuils
here are very insufficient; I must ask Madame Beaurepas for
another.&nbsp; Thank you; a little more to the left, please; that
will do.&nbsp; Are you particularly engaged?&rdquo; she inquired
after she had seated herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;If not I should like
briefly to converse with you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s some time since
I&rsquo;ve met a young American of your&mdash;what shall I call
it?&mdash;affiliations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned your name from
Madame Beaurepas; I must have known in other days some of your
people.&nbsp; I ask myself what has become of all my
friends.&nbsp; I used to have a charming little circle at home,
but now I meet no one I either <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>know or desire to know.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a great difference between
the people one meets and the people one would like to meet?&nbsp;
Fortunately, sometimes,&rdquo; my patroness graciously added,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no great difference.&nbsp; I suppose
you&rsquo;re a specimen&mdash;and I take you for a good
one,&rdquo; she imperturbably went on&mdash;&ldquo;of modern
young America.&nbsp; Tell me, then, what modern young America is
thinking of in these strange days of ours.&nbsp; What are its
feelings, its opinions, its aspirations?&nbsp; What is its
<i>ideal</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had seated myself and she had
pointed this interrogation with the gaze of her curiously bright
and impersonal little eyes.&nbsp; I felt it embarrassing to be
taken for a superior specimen of modern young America and to be
expected to answer for looming millions.&nbsp; Observing my
hesitation Mrs. Church clasped her hands on the open page of her
book and gave a dismal, a desperate smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Has</i> it an ideal?&rdquo; she softly asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, we must talk of this,&rdquo; she proceeded without
insisting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak just now for yourself simply.&nbsp;
Have you come to Europe to any intelligent conscious
end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great end to boast of,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I seem to feel myself study a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
gathering up a little European culture; that&rsquo;s what we
lack, you know, at home.&nbsp; No individual can do much, of
course; but one mustn&rsquo;t be discouraged&mdash;every little
so counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you at least are doing your part,&rdquo; I
bravely answered, dropping my eyes on my companion&rsquo;s
learned volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, I go as straight as possible to the
sources.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one after all like the
Germans.&nbsp; That is for digging up the facts and the
evidence.&nbsp; For conclusions I frequently diverge.&nbsp; I
form my opinions myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry to say,
however,&rdquo; Mrs. Church continued, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t
do much to spread the light.&nbsp; <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m sadly
selfish; I do little to irrigate the soil.&nbsp; I belong&mdash;I
frankly confess it&mdash;to the class of impenitent
absentees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure, last evening,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;of making the acquaintance of your daughter.&nbsp; She
tells me you&rsquo;ve been a long time in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it blandly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can one ever be <i>too</i>
long?&nbsp; You see it&rsquo;s <i>our</i> world, that of us few
real fugitives from the rule of the mob.&nbsp; We shall never go
back to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter nevertheless fancies she yearns!&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she been taking you into her confidence?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a more sensible young lady than she sometimes
appears.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve taken great pains with her; she&rsquo;s
really&mdash;I may be permitted to say it&mdash;superbly
educated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seemed to me to do you honour,&rdquo; I made
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I hear she speaks fluently four
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Church in
the tone of one sated with fluencies and disillusioned of
diplomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has made what we call <i>de fortes
&eacute;tudes</i>&mdash;such as I suppose you&rsquo;re making
now.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s familiar with the results of modern
science; she keeps pace with the new historical
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she has gone much further
than I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to look at me a moment as for the tip of the ear of
irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;You doubtless think I exaggerate, and you
force me therefore to mention the fact that I speak of such
matters with a certain intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never dream of doubting it,&rdquo; I returned,
&ldquo;but your daughter nevertheless strongly holds that you
ought to take her home.&rdquo;&nbsp; I might have feared that
these words would practically represent treachery to the young
lady, but I was reassured by seeing them <a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>produce in
her mother&rsquo;s placid surface no symptom whatever of
irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter has her little theories,&rdquo; that lady
observed; &ldquo;she has, I may say, her small fond illusions and
rebellions.&nbsp; And what wonder!&nbsp; What would youth be
without its Sturm and Drang?&nbsp; Aurora says to
herself&mdash;all at her ease&mdash;that she would be happier in
their dreadful New York, in their dreary Boston, in their
desperate Philadelphia, than in one of the charming old cities in
which our lot is cast.&nbsp; But she knows not what she babbles
of&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; We must allow our children their
yearning to make mistakes, mustn&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; But we must
keep the mistakes down to as few as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her soft sweet positiveness, beneath which I recognised all
sorts of really hard rigours of resistance and aggression,
somehow breathed a chill on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;American
cities,&rdquo; I none the less threw off, &ldquo;are the paradise
of the female young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; she inquired, &ldquo;that the
generations reared in those places are angels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said resolutely, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
the nicest of all girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young lady&mdash;what&rsquo;s her odd
name?&mdash;with whom my daughter has formed a somewhat
precipitate acquaintance: is Miss Ruck an angel and one of the
nicest of all?&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she amusedly
added, &ldquo;force you to describe her as she deserves.&nbsp; It
would be too cruel to make a single exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I at any rate pleaded, &ldquo;in America
they&rsquo;ve the easiest lot and the best time.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve the most innocent liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My companion laid her hand an instant on my arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear young friend, I know America, I know the
conditions of life there down to the ground.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
perhaps no subject on which I&rsquo;ve reflected more than on our
national idiosyncrasies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>&ldquo;To the effect, I see, of your holding them in
horror,&rdquo; I said a little roughly.</p>
<p>Rude indeed as was my young presumption Mrs. Church had still
her cultivated patience, even her pity, for it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very crude,&rdquo; she blandly remarked,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;re proportionately indigestible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And lest her own refined strictures should seem to savour of the
vice she deprecated she went on to explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are two classes of minds, you know&mdash;those that hold back and
those that push forward.&nbsp; My daughter and I are not pushers;
we move with the slow considerate steps to which a little dignity
may still cling.&nbsp; We like the old trodden paths; we like the
old old world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you know what you like.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a great virtue in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we like Europe; we prefer it.&nbsp; We like the
opportunities of Europe; we like the <i>rest</i>.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s so much in that, you know.&nbsp; The world seems to
me to be hurrying, pressing forward so fiercely, without knowing
in the least where it&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whither?&rsquo;
I often ask in my little quiet way.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve yet to
learn that any one can tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a grand old conservative,&rdquo; I
returned while I wondered whether I myself might have been able
to meet her question.</p>
<p>Mrs. Church gave me a smile that was equivalent to a
confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish to retain a wee bit&mdash;just a
wee bit.&nbsp; Surely we&rsquo;ve done so much we might rest a
while; we might pause.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all my
feeling&mdash;just to stop a little, to wait, to take
breath.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen so many changes.&nbsp; I want to
draw in, to draw in&mdash;to hold back, to hold back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t hold your daughter back!&rdquo; I
laughed as I got up.&nbsp; I rose not by way of closing our small
discussion, for I felt my friend&rsquo;s exposition of her views
to be by no means complete, but in order to <a
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>offer a
chair to Miss Aurora, who at this moment drew near.&nbsp; She
thanked me and remained standing, but without at first, as I
noticed, really facing her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been engaged with your new acquaintance,
my dear?&rdquo; this lady inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; said the girl with a sort of prompt
sweet dryness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find her very edifying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurora had a silence; then she met her mother&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, mamma.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
very fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ventured a respectful laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother has
another word for that.&nbsp; But I must not,&rdquo; I added,
&ldquo;be indigestibly raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, vous m&rsquo;en voulez?&rdquo; Mrs. Church serenely
sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet I can&rsquo;t pretend I said it in
jest.&nbsp; I feel it too much.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been having a
little social discussion,&rdquo; she said to her daughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still so much to be said.&nbsp; And I
wish,&rdquo; she continued, turning to me, &ldquo;that I could
give you our point of view.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wish, Aurora,
that we could give him our point of view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; said Aurora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We consider ourselves very fortunate in our point of
view, don&rsquo;t we, dearest?&rdquo; mamma demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fortunate indeed, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we&rsquo;ve acquired an insight into European
life,&rdquo; the elder lady pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve our
place at many a European fireside.&nbsp; We find so much to
esteem&mdash;so much to enjoy.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we find
delightful things, my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So very delightful, mamma,&rdquo; the girl went on with
her colourless calm.&nbsp; I wondered at it; it offered so
strange a contrast to the mocking freedom of her tone the night
before; but while I wondered I desired to testify to the interest
at least with which she inspired me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what impression you ladies may <a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>have found
at European firesides,&rdquo; I again ventured, &ldquo;but there
can be very little doubt of the impression you must have made
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Church got in motion to acknowledge my compliment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spent some charming hours.&nbsp; And that
reminds me that we&rsquo;ve just now such an occasion in
prospect.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re to call upon some Genevese
friends&mdash;the family of the Pasteur Galopin.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re to go with us to the old library at the H&ocirc;tel
de Ville, where there are some very interesting documents of the
period of the Reformation: we&rsquo;re promised a glimpse of some
manuscripts of poor Servetus, the antagonist and victim, you
know, of the dire Calvin.&nbsp; Here of course one can only speak
of ce monsieur under one&rsquo;s breath, but some day when
we&rsquo;re more private&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Church looked round
the room&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my view of him.&nbsp; I
think it has a force of its own.&nbsp; Aurora&rsquo;s familiar
with it&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you, my daughter, familiar with my
view of the evil genius of the Reformation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma&mdash;<i>very</i>,&rdquo; said Aurora with
docility&mdash;and also, as I thought, with subtlety&mdash;while
the two ladies went to prepare for their visit to the Pasteur
Galopin.</p>
<h3><a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>VI</h3>
<p>&ldquo;She has demanded a new lamp: I told you she
would!&rdquo;&nbsp; This communication was made me by Madame
Beaurepas a couple of days later.&nbsp; &ldquo;And she has asked
for a new tapis de lit, and she has requested me to provide
C&eacute;lestine with a pair of light shoes.&nbsp; I remarked to
her that, as a general thing, domestic drudges aren&rsquo;t shod
with satin.&nbsp; That brave C&eacute;lestine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Church may be exacting,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;s a clever little woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady who pays but five francs and a half
shouldn&rsquo;t be too clever.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est
d&eacute;plac&eacute;.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like the
type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What type then,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;do you pronounce
Mrs. Church&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu,&rdquo; said Madame Beaurepas,
&ldquo;c&rsquo;est une de ces mamans, comme vous en avez, qui
prom&egrave;nent leur fille.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to marry her daughter?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madame Beaurepas shrewdly held to her idea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying it in her own way; she does it very
quietly.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t want an American; she wants a
foreigner.&nbsp; And she wants a mari s&eacute;rieux.&nbsp; But
she&rsquo;s travelling over Europe in search of one.&nbsp; She
would like a magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magistrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>&ldquo;A gros bonnet of some kind; a professor or a
deputy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for the poor girl,&rdquo; I
found myself moved to declare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pity her too much; she&rsquo;s a
<i>fine mouche</i>&mdash;a sly thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, for that, no!&rdquo; I protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no fool, but she&rsquo;s an honest
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hostess gave an ancient grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has hooked
you, eh?&nbsp; But the mother won&rsquo;t have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I developed my idea without heeding this insinuation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a charming girl, but she&rsquo;s a shrewd
politician.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a necessity of her case.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s less submissive to her mother than she has to pretend
to be.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s in self-defence.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s to
make her life possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to get away from her
mother&rdquo;&mdash;Madame Beaurepas so far confirmed me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wants to <i>courir les champs</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to go to America, her native
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;ll certainly manage
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fine morning&mdash;or evening&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
go off with a young man; probably with a young
American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allons donc!&rdquo; I cried with disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be quite America enough,&rdquo; pursued my
cynical hostess.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept a boarding-house
for nearly half a century.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen that
type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have such things as that happened chez vous?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything has happened chez moi.&nbsp; But nothing has
happened more than once.&nbsp; Therefore this won&rsquo;t happen
here.&nbsp; It will be at the next place they go to, or the
next.&nbsp; Besides, there&rsquo;s here no young American pour la
partie&mdash;none except you, monsieur.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
susceptible but you&rsquo;re too reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you I&rsquo;m reasonable,&rdquo; I
answered.&nbsp; <a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thanks to my cold blood you escape a
scolding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One morning about this time, instead of coming back to
breakfast at the pension after my lectures at the Academy, I went
to partake of this meal with a fellow student at an ancient
eating-house in the collegiate quarter.&nbsp; On separating from
my friend I took my way along that charming public walk known in
Geneva as the Treille, a shady terrace, of immense elevation,
overhanging a stretch of the lower town.&nbsp; Here are spreading
trees and well-worn benches, and over the tiles and chimneys of
the <i>ville basse</i> a view of the snow-crested Alps.&nbsp; On
the other side, as you turn your back to the view, the high level
is overlooked by a row of tall sober-faced <i>h&ocirc;tels</i>,
the dwellings of the local aristocracy.&nbsp; I was fond of the
place, resorting to it for stimulation of my sense of the social
scene at large.&nbsp; Presently, as I lingered there on this
occasion, I became aware of a gentleman seated not far from where
I stood, his back to the Alpine chain, which this morning was all
radiant, and a newspaper unfolded in his lap.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t reading, however; he only stared before him in
gloomy contemplation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I
recognised first the newspaper or its detainer; one, in either
case, would have helped me to identify the other.&nbsp; One was
the <i>New York Herald</i>&mdash;the other of course was Mr.
Ruck.&nbsp; As I drew nearer he moved his eyes from the stony
succession, the grey old high-featured house-masks, on the other
side of the terrace, and I knew by the expression of his face
just how he had been feeling about these distinguished
abodes.&nbsp; He had made up his mind that their proprietors were
a &ldquo;mean&rdquo; narrow-minded unsociable company that
plunged its knotted roots into a superfluous past.&nbsp; I
endeavoured therefore, as I sat down beside him, to strike a
pleasanter note.</p>
<p><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>&ldquo;The Alps, from here, do make a wondrous
show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Ruck without a stir,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve examined the Alps.&nbsp; Fine thing in its way,
the view&mdash;fine thing.&nbsp; Beauties of nature&mdash;that
sort of thing.&nbsp; We came up on purpose to look at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladies then have been with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I guess they&rsquo;re fooling round.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re awfully restless.&nbsp; They keep saying
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> restless, but I&rsquo;m as quiet as a sleeping
child to <i>them</i>.&nbsp; It takes,&rdquo; he added in a moment
dryly, &ldquo;the form of an interest in the stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are the stores what they&rsquo;re after
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;unless this is one of the days the stores
don&rsquo;t keep.&nbsp; They regret them, but I wish there were
more of them!&nbsp; They told me to sit here a while and
they&rsquo;d just have a look.&nbsp; I generally know what that
means&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>their</i> form of scenery.&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s the principal interest for ladies,&rdquo; he added,
retracting his irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d come up
here and see the cathedral; Mrs. Church seemed to think it a dead
loss we shouldn&rsquo;t see the cathedral, especially as we
hadn&rsquo;t seen many yet.&nbsp; And I had to come up to the
banker&rsquo;s anyway.&nbsp; Well, we certainly saw the
cathedral.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as we&rsquo;re any the better
for it, and I don&rsquo;t know as I should know it again.&nbsp;
But we saw it anyway, stone by stone&mdash;and heard about it
century by century.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as I should want to
go there regularly, but I suppose it will give us in conversation
a kind of hold on Mrs. Church, hey?&nbsp; I guess we want
something of that kind.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; Mr. Ruck continued,
&ldquo;I stepped in at the banker&rsquo;s to see if there
wasn&rsquo;t something, and they handed me out an old
<i>Herald</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> full of good
news,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say it is.&nbsp; Damned bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>&ldquo;Political,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;or
commercial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hang politics!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s business, sir.&nbsp;
There <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> any business.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all gone
to&mdash;&rdquo; and Mr. Ruck became profane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nine
failures in one day, and two of them in our locality.&nbsp; What
do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greatly hope they haven&rsquo;t inconvenienced
you,&rdquo; was all I could gratify him with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess they haven&rsquo;t affected me quite
desirably.&nbsp; So many houses on fire, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
If they happen to take place right where you live they
don&rsquo;t increase the value of your own property.&nbsp; When
mine catches I suppose they&rsquo;ll write and tell me&mdash;one
of these days when they get round to me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get
a blamed letter this morning; I suppose they think I&rsquo;m
having such a good time over here it&rsquo;s a pity to break
in.&nbsp; If I could attend to business for about half an hour
I&rsquo;d find out something.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t, and
it&rsquo;s no use talking.&nbsp; The state of my health was never
so unsatisfactory as it was about five o&rsquo;clock this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear that,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and I recommend you strongly not to think of
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Ruck replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t <i>make</i> me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking
of cathedrals.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking of the way they used to
chain you up under them or burn you up in front of them&mdash;in
those high old times.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking of the beauties of
nature too,&rdquo; he went on, turning round on the bench and
leaning his elbow on the parapet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can get killed
over there I suppose also&rdquo;&mdash;and he nodded at the
shining crests.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of going
over&mdash;because, whatever the danger, I seem more afraid not
to.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I do most things.&nbsp; How do you get
over?&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to Chamouni?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to those hills.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t they run a train
right up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go to Chamouni,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can go <a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
392</span>to Grindelwald and Zermatt and fifty other
places.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t go by rail, but you can
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll drive&mdash;you can&rsquo;t tell
the difference in these cars.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Ruck
proceeded, &ldquo;Chamouni&rsquo;s one of the places we put
down.&nbsp; I hope there are good stores in
Chamouni.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke with a quickened ring and with an
irony more pointed than commonly served him.&nbsp; It was as if
he had been wrought upon, and yet his general submission to fate
was still there.&nbsp; I judged he had simply taken, in the face
of disaster, a sudden sublime resolution not to worry.&nbsp; He
presently twisted himself about on his bench again and began to
look out for his companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, they <i>are</i>
taking a look,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve
struck something somewhere.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve got a
carriage waiting outside of that archway too.&nbsp; They seem to
do a big business in archways here, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; They
like to have a carriage to carry home the things&mdash;those
ladies of mine.&nbsp; Then they&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;ve got
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ladies, after this, to do them
justice, were not very long in appearing.&nbsp; They came toward
us from under the archway to which Mr. Ruck had somewhat
invidiously alluded, slowly and with a jaded air.&nbsp; My
companion watched them as they advanced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re right down tired.&nbsp; When they look like
that it kind o&rsquo; foots up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ruck, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
you&rsquo;ve had some company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband looked at
her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, and I suspected that
her unusually gracious observation was prompted by the less
innocent aftertaste of her own late pastime.</p>
<p>Her daughter glanced at me with the habit of straighter
defiance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have been more proper if
<i>we</i> had had the company.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you come
after us instead of sneaking there?&rdquo; she asked of Mr.
Ruck&rsquo;s companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told by your father,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;that you <a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>were engaged in sacred rites.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Miss Ruck
was less conciliatory it would be scarcely, I felt sure, because
she had been more frugal.&nbsp; It was rather because her
conception of social intercourse appeared to consist of the
imputation to as many persons as possible&mdash;that is to as
many subject males&mdash;of some scandalous neglect of her charms
and her claims.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, for a gentleman there&rsquo;s
nothing so sacred as ladies&rsquo; society,&rdquo; she replied in
the manner of a person accustomed to giving neat retorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you refer to the cathedral,&rdquo; said her
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I must say we didn&rsquo;t go back
there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what it may be for regular
attendants, but it doesn&rsquo;t meet my idea of a really
pleasant place of worship.&nbsp; Few of these old buildings
do,&rdquo; Mrs. Ruck further mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we discovered a little lace-shop, where I guess I
could regularly attend!&rdquo; her daughter took occasion to
announce without weak delay.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck looked at his child; then he turned about again,
leaning on the parapet and gazing away at the
&ldquo;hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the place was certainly not expensive,&rdquo; his
wife said with her eyes also on the Alps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up to Chamouni,&rdquo; he
pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any call for lace up
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;ve decided to go
somewhere,&rdquo; Mrs. Ruck returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to be a fixture at an old pension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can wear lace anywhere,&rdquo; her daughter
reminded us, &ldquo;if you put it on right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the great thing with lace.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think they know
how to wear lace in Europe.&nbsp; I know how I mean to wear mine;
but I mean to keep it till I get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck transferred his melancholy gaze to her
elaborately-appointed little person; there was a great deal of
very new-looking detail in Miss Ruck&rsquo;s <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>appearance.&nbsp; Then in a tone of voice quite out of
consonance with his facial despondency, &ldquo;Have you purchased
a great deal?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve purchased enough for you to make a fuss
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t make a fuss about <i>that</i>,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;&mdash;the girl had
unshaken confidence.</p>
<p>The subject of this serenity, however, went on in the same
tone: &ldquo;Have you got it in your pocket?&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you put it on&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you hang it round
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang it round <i>you</i> if you don&rsquo;t
look out!&rdquo; cried Miss Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to show it off to this
gentleman?&rdquo; he sociably continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, how you do carry on!&rdquo; his wife sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to be lively.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s every
reason for it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going up to Chamouni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re real restless&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Ruck
roused herself from her own repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never felt so quiet.&nbsp; I feel as peaceful as a
little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruck, who had no play of mind, looked at her daughter and
at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll improve,&rdquo; she
stated with a certain flatness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send in the bills,&rdquo; he went on, rising to
match.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself suffer from want,
Sophy.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care what you do now.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t be more than gay, and we can&rsquo;t be worse than
broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy joined her mother with a little toss of her head, and we
followed the ladies to the carriage, where the younger addressed
her father.&nbsp; &ldquo;In your place, Mr. Ruck, I
wouldn&rsquo;t want to flaunt my meanness quite so much before
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>He
appeared to feel the force of this rebuke, surely deserved by a
man on whom the humiliation of seeing the main ornaments of his
hearth betray the ascendency of that character had never yet been
laid.&nbsp; He flushed and was silent; his companions got into
their vehicle, the front seat of which was adorned with a large
parcel.&nbsp; Mr. Ruck gave the parcel a poke with his umbrella
and turned to me with a grimly penitent smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
all, for the ladies, that&rsquo;s the principal
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>VII</h3>
<p>Old M. Pigeonneau had more than once offered me the privilege
of a walk in his company, but his invitation had hitherto, for
one reason or another, always found me hampered.&nbsp; It befell,
however, one afternoon that I saw him go forth for a vague airing
with an unattended patience that attracted my sympathy.&nbsp; I
hastily overtook him and passed my hand into his venerable arm,
an overture that produced in the good old man so rejoicing a
response that he at once proposed we should direct our steps to
the English Garden: no scene less consecrated to social ease was
worthy of our union.&nbsp; To the English Garden accordingly we
went; it lay beyond the bridge and beside the lake.&nbsp; It was
always pretty and now was really recreative; a band played
furiously in the centre and a number of discreet listeners sat
under the small trees on benches and little chairs or strolled
beside the blue water.&nbsp; We joined the strollers, we observed
our companions and conversed on obvious topics.&nbsp; Some of
these last, of course, were the pretty women who graced the
prospect and who, in the light of M. Pigeonneau&rsquo;s
comprehensive criticism, appeared surprisingly numerous.&nbsp; He
seemed bent upon our making up our minds as to which might be
prettiest, and this was an innocent game in which I consented to
take a hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly my companion stopped, pressing my arm <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>with the
liveliest emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;La voil&agrave;, la voil&agrave;,
the prettiest!&rdquo; he quickly murmured; &ldquo;coming toward
us in a blue dress with the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at the
other I was looking, for the other, to my surprise, was our
interesting fellow pensioner, the daughter of the most systematic
of mothers.&nbsp; M. Pigeonneau meanwhile had redoubled his
transports&mdash;he had recognised Miss Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh la
belle rencontre, nos aimables convives&mdash;the prettiest girl
in the world in effect!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then after we had
greeted and joined the young ladies, who, like ourselves, were
walking arm in arm and enjoying the scene, he addressed himself
to the special object of his admiration, Mees Roque.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was citing you with enthusiasm to my young friend here
even before I had recognised you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in French compliments,&rdquo;
remarked Miss Sophy, who presented her back to the smiling old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you and Miss Ruck walking alone?&rdquo; I asked of
her companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better accept M.
Pigeonneau&rsquo;s gallant protection, to say nothing of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurora Church had taken her hand from Miss Ruck&rsquo;s arm;
she inclined her head to the side and shone at me while her open
parasol revolved on her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which is most
improper&mdash;to walk alone or to walk with gentlemen that one
picks up?&nbsp; I want to do what&rsquo;s most
improper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What perversity,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;are you, with
an ingenuity worthy of a better cause, trying to work
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks you can&rsquo;t understand him when he talks
like that,&rdquo; said Miss Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I <i>do</i>
understand you,&rdquo; she flirted at
me&mdash;&ldquo;always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve always ventured to hope, my dear Miss
Ruck.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>&ldquo;Well, if I didn&rsquo;t it wouldn&rsquo;t be
much loss!&rdquo; cried this young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allons, en marche!&rdquo; trumpeted M. Pigeonneau, all
gallant urbanity and undiscouraged by her impertinence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us make together the tour of the garden.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he attached himself to Miss Ruck with a respectful elderly
grace which treated her own lack even of the juvenile form of
that attraction as some flower of alien modesty, and was ever
sublimely conscious of a mission to place modesty at its
ease.&nbsp; This ill-assorted couple walked in front, while
Aurora Church and I strolled along together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this is more improper,&rdquo; said my
companion; &ldquo;this is delightfully improper.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say that as a compliment to you,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it to any clinging man, no
matter how stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m clinging enough,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m as stupid as you could wish, and this
doesn&rsquo;t seem to me wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for you, no; only for me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing that a man can do that&rsquo;s wrong, is there?&nbsp;
<i>En morale</i>, you know, I mean.&nbsp; Ah, yes, he can kill
and steal; but I think there&rsquo;s nothing else, is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a nice question.&nbsp; One
doesn&rsquo;t know how those things are taken till after one has
done them.&nbsp; Then one&rsquo;s enlightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean you&rsquo;ve never been enlightened?&nbsp;
You make yourself out very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than making one&rsquo;s self out
very bad, as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know
the consequences of a false position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was amused at her great formula.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
mean by yours being one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I mean everything.&nbsp; For instance, I&rsquo;ve to
pretend to be a jeune fille.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a jeune fille;
no American girl&rsquo;s a jeune fille; an American girl&rsquo;s
<a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>an
intelligent responsible creature.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve to pretend to
be idiotically innocent, but I&rsquo;m not in the least
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, however, was easy to meet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
in the least pretend to be innocent; you pretend to be&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;uncannily wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no pretence.&nbsp; I <i>am</i> uncannily
wise.&nbsp; You could call it nothing more true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went along with her a little, rather thrilled by this finer
freedom.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re essentially not an American
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She almost stopped, looking at me; there came a flush to her
cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my false position.&nbsp; I want to be an
American girl, and I&rsquo;ve been hideously deprived of that
immense convenience, that beautiful resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to tell you?&rdquo; I pursued with
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be utterly impossible to an
American girl&mdash;I mean unperverted, and that&rsquo;s the
whole point&mdash;to talk as you&rsquo;re talking to me
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expressive eagerness she showed for this was
charming.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please tell me then!&nbsp; How would she
talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you all the things she&rsquo;d say,
but I think I can tell you most of the things she
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t reason out her conduct
as you seem to me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurora gave me the most flattering attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
see.&nbsp; She would be simpler.&nbsp; To do very simply things
not at all simple&mdash;that&rsquo;s the American
girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I greatly enjoyed our intellectual relation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re a French girl, or what you
are, but, you know, I find you witty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you mean I strike false notes!&rdquo; she quite
comically wailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;See how my whole sense for such
things has been ruined.&nbsp; False notes are just what I want to
avoid.&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d always tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 400</span>The
conversational union between Miss Ruck and her neighbour, in
front of us, had evidently not borne fruit.&nbsp; Miss Ruck
suddenly turned round to us with a question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want some ice-cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> doesn&rsquo;t strike false notes,&rdquo; I
declared.</p>
<p>We had come into view of a manner of pavilion or large kiosk,
which served as a caf&eacute; and at which the delicacies
generally procurable at such an establishment were
dispensed.&nbsp; Miss Ruck pointed to the little green tables and
chairs set out on the gravel; M. Pigeonneau, fluttering with a
sense of dissipation, seconded the proposal, and we presently sat
down and gave our order to a nimble attendant.&nbsp; I managed
again to place myself next Aurora; our companions were on the
other side of the table.</p>
<p>My neighbour rejoiced to extravagance in our situation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is best of all&mdash;I never believed I should come
to a caf&eacute; with two strange and possibly depraved
men!&nbsp; Now you can&rsquo;t persuade me this isn&rsquo;t
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make it wrong,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;we ought to
see your mother coming down that path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my mother makes everything wrong,&rdquo; she cried,
attacking with a little spoon in the shape of a spade the apex of
a pink ice.&nbsp; And then she returned to her idea of a moment
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must promise to tell me&mdash;to warn me
in some way&mdash;whenever I strike a false note.&nbsp; You must
give a little cough, like that&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep me very busy and people will think
I&rsquo;m in a consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voyons,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;why have you never
talked to me more?&nbsp; Is that a false note?&nbsp; Why
haven&rsquo;t you been &lsquo;attentive&rsquo;?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what American girls call it; that&rsquo;s what Miss
Ruck calls it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured myself that our companions were out of ear-shot and
that Miss Ruck was much occupied with <a name="page401"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 401</span>a large vanilla cream.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re always interlaced with that young
lady.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no getting near you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurora watched her friend while the latter devoted herself to
her ice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wonder, no doubt, why I should care for
her at all.&nbsp; So does mamma; elle s&rsquo;y perd.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like her particularly; je n&rsquo;en suis pas
folle.&nbsp; But she gives me information; she tells me about
her&mdash;your&mdash;everything but <i>my</i>&mdash;extraordinary
country.&nbsp; Mamma has always tried to prevent my knowing
anything about it, and I&rsquo;m all the more devoured with
curiosity.&nbsp; And then Miss Ruck&rsquo;s so very
fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not be so fresh as Miss Ruck,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but in future, when you want information, I recommend you
to come to me for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but our friend offers to take me there; she invites
me to go back with her, to stay with her.&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t do that, could you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And my companion
beautifully faced me on it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bon, a false note!&nbsp;
I can see it by your face; you remind me of an outraged
ma&icirc;tre de piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overdo the character&mdash;the poor American
girl,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you going to stay with that
delightful family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and stay with any one who will take me or
ask me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a real nostalgie.&nbsp; She says that in
New York&mdash;in Thirty-Seventh Street near Fourth
Avenue&mdash;I should have the most lovely time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;d enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolute liberty to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you&rsquo;ve a certain liberty
here,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>this</i>?&nbsp; Oh I shall pay for this.&nbsp; I
shall be punished by mamma and lectured by Madame
Galopin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wife of the pasteur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His digne &eacute;pouse.&nbsp; Madame Galopin, for
mamma, <a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>is the incarnation of European opinion.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what vexes me with mamma, her thinking so much of
people like Madame Galopin.&nbsp; Going to see Madame
Galopin&mdash;mamma calls that being in European society.&nbsp;
European society!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so sick of that expression;
I&rsquo;ve heard it since I was six years old.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
Madame Galopin&mdash;who the devil thinks anything of her
here?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s nobody; she&rsquo;s the dreariest of
frumps; she&rsquo;s perfectly third-rate.&nbsp; If I like your
America better than mamma I also know my Europe
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your mother, certainly,&rdquo; I objected a trifle
timidly&mdash;for my young lady was excited and had a charming
little passion in her eye&mdash;&ldquo;your mother has a great
many social relations all over the continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks so, but half the people don&rsquo;t care for
us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not so good as we and they know
it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do them that justice&mdash;so that they
wonder why we should care for them.&nbsp; When we&rsquo;re polite
to them they think the less of us; there are plenty of people
like that.&nbsp; Mamma thinks so much of them simply because
they&rsquo;re foreigners.&nbsp; If I could tell you all the ugly
stupid tenth-rate people I&rsquo;ve had to talk to for no better
reason than that they were <i>de leur pays</i>!&mdash;Germans,
French, Italians, Turks, everything.&nbsp; When I complain mamma
always says that at any rate it&rsquo;s practice in the
language.&nbsp; And she makes so much of the most impossible
English too; I don&rsquo;t know what <i>that&rsquo;s</i> practice
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I had time to suggest an hypothesis as regards this
latter point I saw something that made me rise&mdash;I fear with
an undissimulated start&mdash;from my chair.&nbsp; This was
nothing less than the neat little figure of Mrs. Church&mdash;a
perfect model of the femme comme il faut&mdash;approaching our
table with an impatient step and followed most unexpectedly in
her advance by the pre-eminent form of Mr. Ruck, whose <a
name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>high hat
had never looked so high.&nbsp; She had evidently come in search
of her daughter, and if she had commanded this gentleman&rsquo;s
attendance it had been on no more intimate ground than that of
his unenvied paternity to her guilty child&rsquo;s
accomplice.&nbsp; My movement had given the alarm and my young
friend and M. Pigeonneau got up; Miss Ruck alone didn&rsquo;t, in
the local phrase, derange herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Church, beneath her
modest little bonnet, looked thoroughly resolute though not at
all agitated; she came straight to her daughter, who received her
with a smile, and then she took the rest of us in very fixedly
and tranquilly and without bowing.&nbsp; I must do both these
ladies the justice that neither of them made the least little
&ldquo;scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for you, dearest,&rdquo; said the
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come for you&mdash;come for you,&rdquo; Mrs. Church
repeated, looking down at the relics of our little feast, on
which she seemed somehow to shed at once the lurid light of the
disreputable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was obliged to appeal to Mr.
Ruck&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp; I was much perplexed.&nbsp; I
thought a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Church, I was glad to see you perplexed once
in your life!&rdquo; cried Mr. Ruck with friendly jocosity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you came pretty straight for all that.&nbsp; I had
hard work to keep up with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a cab, Aurora,&rdquo; Mrs. Church went
on without heeding this pleasantry&mdash;&ldquo;a closed one;
we&rsquo;ll enter it at once.&nbsp; Come, ma fille.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear mamma.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl had flushed for
humiliation, but she carried it bravely off; and her grimace as
she looked round at us all and her eyes met mine didn&rsquo;t
keep her, I thought, from being beautiful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a ripping time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t linger,&rdquo; said her mother;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s <a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re to dine, you
know, with Madame Galopin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had quite forgotten,&rdquo; Aurora declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That will be even more charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to assist you to carry her back,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ruck.</p>
<p>Mrs. Church covered him for a little with her coldest
contemplation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you prefer then to leave your
daughter to finish the evening with these gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck pushed back his hat and scratched the top of his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; How&rsquo;d
you like that, Sophy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; gasped Sophy as Mrs. Church
marched off with her daughter.</p>
<h3><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>VIII</h3>
<p>I had half-expected a person of so much decision, and above
all of so much consistency, would make me feel the weight of her
disapproval of my own share in that little act of revelry by the
most raffish part of the lakeside.&nbsp; But she maintained her
claim to being a highly reasonable woman&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
but admire the justice of this pretension&mdash;by recognising my
practical detachment.&nbsp; I had taken her daughter as I found
her, which was, according to Mrs. Church&rsquo;s view, in a very
equivocal position.&nbsp; The natural instinct of a young man in
such a situation is not to protest but to profit; and it was
clear to Mrs. Church that I had had nothing to do with Miss
Aurora&rsquo;s appearing in public under the compromising
countenance, as she regarded the matter, of Miss Ruck.&nbsp;
Besides, she liked to converse, and she apparently did me the
honour to consider that of all the inmates of the Pension
Beaurepas I was the best prepared for that exercise.&nbsp; I
found her in the salon a couple of evenings after the incident I
have just narrated, and I approached her with a view to making my
peace with her if this should prove necessary.&nbsp; But Mrs.
Church was as gracious as I could have desired; she put her
marker into her inveterate volume and folded her plump little
hands on the cover.&nbsp; She made no specific allusion to the
English Garden; she embarked rather on those general
considerations in which her cultivated mind was so much at
home.</p>
<p><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
406</span>&ldquo;Always at your deep studies, Mrs. Church,&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t hesitate freely to observe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Que voulez-vous, monsieur?&nbsp; To say studies is to
say too much; one doesn&rsquo;t study in the parlour of a
boarding-house of this character.&nbsp; But I do what I can;
I&rsquo;ve always done what I can.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
I&rsquo;ve ever claimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can do more, and you appear to have done a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know my secret?&rdquo; she asked with an air of
brightening confidence.&nbsp; And this treasure hung there a
little temptingly before she revealed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;To care
only for the <i>best</i>!&nbsp; To do the best, to know the
best&mdash;to have, to desire, to recognise, only the best.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always done in my little quiet
persistent way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone through Europe on my
devoted little errand, seeking, seeing, heeding, only the
best.&nbsp; And it hasn&rsquo;t been for myself alone&mdash;it
has been for my daughter.&nbsp; My daughter has had the
best.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not rich, but I can say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has had <i>you</i>, madam,&rdquo; I pronounced
finely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, such as I am, I&rsquo;ve been devoted.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve got something everywhere; a little here, a little
there.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the real secret&mdash;to get something
everywhere; you always can if you <i>are</i> devoted.&nbsp;
Sometimes it has been a little music, sometimes a little deeper
insight into the history of art; sometimes into that of
literature, politics, economics: every little counts, you
know.&nbsp; Sometimes it has been just a glimpse, a view, a
lovely landscape, a mere impression.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve always
been on the look-out.&nbsp; Sometimes it has been a valued
friendship, a delightful social tie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the &lsquo;European society,&rsquo; the poor
daughter&rsquo;s bugbear,&rdquo; I said to myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I remarked aloud&mdash;I admit rather
hypocritically&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve lived a great deal in
pensions you must have got acquainted with lots of
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>Mrs.
Church dropped her eyes an instant; taking it up, however, as one
for whom discrimination was always at hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
the European pension system in many respects remarkable and in
some satisfactory.&nbsp; But of the friendships that we&rsquo;ve
formed few have been contracted in establishments of this
stamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that!&rdquo; I ruefully
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it for you, though I might say it for
some others.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been interested in European
<i>homes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah there you&rsquo;re beyond me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally&rdquo;&mdash;she quietly assented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have the entr&eacute;e of the old Genevese
society.&nbsp; I like its tone.&nbsp; I prefer it to that of Mr.
Ruck,&rdquo; added Mrs. Church calmly; &ldquo;to that of Mrs.
Ruck and Miss Ruck.&nbsp; To that of Miss Ruck in
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah the poor Rucks <i>have</i> no tone,&rdquo; I
pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point of them.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t take them more seriously than they take
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, she would see what she could do.&nbsp; But she bent
grave eyes on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they really fair
examples?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examples of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of our American tendencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tendencies&rsquo; is a big word, dear lady;
tendencies are difficult to calculate.&rdquo;&nbsp; I used even a
greater freedom.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you shouldn&rsquo;t abuse those
good Rucks, who have been so kind to your daughter.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve invited her to come and stay with them in
Thirty-Seventh Street near Fourth Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aurora has told me.&nbsp; It might be very
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be very droll,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all too
terrible.&nbsp; I think we shall have to leave the Pension
Beaurepas.&nbsp; I shall go back to Madame Chamousset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of the Rucks?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p><a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>&ldquo;Pray why don&rsquo;t they go themselves?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve given them some excellent addresses&mdash;written down
the very hours of the trains.&nbsp; They were going to Appenzell;
I thought it was arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk of Chamouni now,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but
they&rsquo;re very helpless and undecided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them some Chamouni addresses.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ruck will send for a <i>chaise &agrave; porteurs</i>;
I&rsquo;ll give her the name of a man who lets them lower than
you get them at the hotels.&nbsp; After that they <i>must</i>
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had thoroughly fixed it, as we said; but her large
assumptions ruffled me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I nevertheless doubt,&rdquo;
I returned, &ldquo;if Mr. Ruck will ever really be seen on the
Mer de Glace&mdash;great as might be the effect there of that
high hat.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not like you; he doesn&rsquo;t value
his European privileges.&nbsp; He takes no interest.&nbsp; He
misses Wall Street all the time.&nbsp; As his wife says,
he&rsquo;s deplorably restless, but I guess Chamouni won&rsquo;t
quiet him.&nbsp; So you mustn&rsquo;t depend too much on the
effect of your addresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it, in its strange mixture of the barbaric and the
effete, a frequent type?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Church with all the
force of her noble appetite for knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&nbsp; Mr. Ruck&rsquo;s a
broken-down man of business.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s broken-down in
health and I think he must be broken-down in fortune.&nbsp; He
has spent his whole life in buying and selling and watching
prices, so that he knows how to do nothing else.&nbsp; His wife
and daughter have spent their lives, not in selling, but in
buying&mdash;with a considerable indifference to prices&mdash;and
they on their side know how to do nothing else.&nbsp; To get
something in a &lsquo;store&rsquo; that they can put on their
backs&mdash;that&rsquo;s their one idea; they haven&rsquo;t
another in their heads.&nbsp; Of course they spend no end of
money, and they do it with an implacable persistence, with a
mixture of audacity and of cunning.&nbsp; They do it in his teeth
and they do it behind his <a name="page409"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 409</span>back; the mother protects the
daughter, while the daughter eggs on the mother.&nbsp; Between
them they&rsquo;re bleeding him to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah what a picture!&rdquo; my friend calmly
sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re grossly
illiterate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I share your fears.&nbsp; We make a great talk at home
about education, but see how little that ideal has ever breathed
on them.&nbsp; The vision of fine clothes rides them like a
fury.&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t an idea of any sort&mdash;not even
a worse one&mdash;to compete with it.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Ruck,
who&rsquo;s a mush of personal and private concession&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what he may have been in the business
world&mdash;strikes me as a really tragic figure.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s getting bad news every day from home; his affairs may
be going to the dogs.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s unable, with his lost
nerve, to apply himself; so he has to stand and watch his
fortunes ebb.&nbsp; He has been used to doing things in a big way
and he feels &lsquo;mean&rsquo; if he makes a fuss about
bills.&nbsp; So the ladies keep sending them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t they common sense?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
they know they&rsquo;re marching to ruin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; The duty of an
American husband and father is to keep them going.&nbsp; If he
asks them how, that&rsquo;s his own affair.&nbsp; So by way of
not being mean, of being a good American husband and father, poor
Ruck stands staring at bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Church, with her cold competence, picked my story
over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, if Aurora were to go to stay with them
she mightn&rsquo;t even have a good <i>nourriture</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t on the whole recommend,&rdquo; I smiled,
&ldquo;that your daughter should pay a visit to Thirty-Seventh
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it in&mdash;with its various bearings&mdash;and had
after all, I think, to renounce the shrewd view of a
contingency.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I be subjected to such
trials&mdash;so sadly &eacute;prouve&eacute;?&rdquo;&nbsp; From
the moment <a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>nothing at all was to be got from the Rucks&mdash;not
even eventual gratuitous board&mdash;she washed her hands of them
altogether.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should a daughter of mine like that
dreadful girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Does</i> she like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She challenged me nobly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray do you mean that
Aurora&rsquo;s such a hypocrite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw no reason to hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little, since you
inquire.&nbsp; I think you&rsquo;ve forced her to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;&mdash;she was shocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>never</i> force my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s nevertheless in a false position,&rdquo; I
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;She hungers and thirsts for her own great
country; she wants to &lsquo;come out&rsquo; in New York, which
is certainly, socially speaking, the El Dorado of young
ladies.&nbsp; She likes any one, for the moment, who will talk to
her of that and serve as a connecting-link with the paradise she
imagines there.&nbsp; Miss Ruck performs this agreeable
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your idea is, then, that if she were to go with such a
person to America she could drop her afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I complimented Mrs. Church on her quickly-working mind, but I
explained that I prescribed no such course.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t imagine her&mdash;when it should come to the
point&mdash;embarking with the famille Roque.&nbsp; But I wish
she might go nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Church shook her head lucidly&mdash;she found amusement
in my inappropriate zeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust my poor child may
never be guilty of so fatal a mistake.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
completely in error; she&rsquo;s wholly unadapted to the peculiar
conditions of American life.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t please
her.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t sympathise.&nbsp; My
daughter&rsquo;s ideal&rsquo;s not the ideal of the class of
young women to which Miss Ruck belongs.&nbsp; I fear
they&rsquo;re very numerous; they pervade the place, they give
the tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who are mistaken,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are <a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>plenty of Miss Rucks, and she has a terrible
significance&mdash;though largely as the product of her
weak-kneed sire and his &lsquo;absorption in
business.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there are other forms.&nbsp; Go home
for six months and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not, unfortunately, the means to make costly
experiments.&nbsp; My daughter,&rdquo; Mrs. Church pursued,
&ldquo;has had great advantages&mdash;rare advantages&mdash;and I
should be very sorry to believe that <i>au fond</i> she
doesn&rsquo;t appreciate them.&nbsp; One thing&rsquo;s certain: I
must remove her from this pernicious influence.&nbsp; We must
part company with this deplorable family.&nbsp; If Mr. Ruck and
his ladies can&rsquo;t be induced to proceed to Chamouni&mdash;a
journey from which no traveller with the smallest self-respect
can dispense himself&mdash;my daughter and I shall be obliged to
retire from the field.&nbsp; <i>We</i> shall go to
Dresden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Dresden?&rdquo; I submissively echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The capital of Saxony.&nbsp; I had arranged to go there
for the autumn, but it will be simpler to go immediately.&nbsp;
There are several works in the gallery with which Aurora has not,
I think, sufficiently familiarised herself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
especially strong in the seventeenth-century schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As my companion offered me this information I caught sight of
Mr. Ruck, who lounged in with his hands in his pockets and his
elbows making acute angles.&nbsp; He had his usual anomalous
appearance of both seeking and avoiding society, and he wandered
obliquely toward Mrs. Church, whose last words he had
overheard.&nbsp; &ldquo;The seventeenth-century schools,&rdquo;
he said as if he were slowly weighing some very small object in a
very large pair of scales.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now do you suppose they
<i>had</i> schools at that period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Church rose with a good deal of majesty, making no answer
to this incongruous jest.&nbsp; She clasped her large volume to
her neat little bosom and looked at our luckless friend more in
pity than <a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span>in anger, though more in edification than in
either.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a letter this morning from
Chamouni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he made answer, &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ve got friends all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve friends at Chamouni, but they&rsquo;re
called away.&nbsp; To their great regret.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had got
up too; I listened to this statement and wondered.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to mention my wanton thought.&nbsp; I
asked myself whether this mightn&rsquo;t be a mere extemporised
and unestablished truth&mdash;a truth begotten of a deep desire;
but the point has never been cleared.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
giving up some charming rooms; perhaps you&rsquo;d like
them.&nbsp; I would suggest your telegraphing.&nbsp; The
weather&rsquo;s glorious,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Church,
&ldquo;and the highest peaks are now perceived with extraordinary
distinctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck listened, as he always listened, respectfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I want
to go up Mount Blank.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the principal
attraction, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many others.&nbsp; I thought I would offer
you an exceptional opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;I guess you know, and
if I could <i>let</i> you fix me we&rsquo;d probably have some
big times.&nbsp; But I seem to strike opportunities&mdash;well,
in excess of my powers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem able to
respond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only needs a little decision,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Church with an air that was a perfect example of this
virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you good-night, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she moved noiselessly away.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck, with his long legs apart, stood staring after her;
then he transferred his perfectly quiet eyes to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does she own a hotel over there?&nbsp; Has she got any
stock in Mount Blank?&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed in view of the way he
had answered her I thought the dear man&mdash;to whom I found
myself becoming hourly more attached&mdash;had beautiful
manners.</p>
<h3><a name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
413</span>IX</h3>
<p>The next day Madame Beaurepas held out to me with her own
venerable fingers a missive which proved to be a telegram.&nbsp;
After glancing at it I let her know that it appeared to call me
away.&nbsp; My brother had arrived in England and he proposed I
should meet him there; he had come on business and was to spend
but three weeks in Europe.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my house empties
itself!&rdquo; the old woman cried on this.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
famille Roque talks of leaving me and Madame Cheurche nous fait
la r&eacute;ver&eacute;nce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Church is going away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s packing her trunk; she&rsquo;s a very
extraordinary person.&nbsp; Do you know what she asked me this
morning?&nbsp; To invent some combination by which the famille
Roque should take itself off.&nbsp; I assured her I was no such
inventor.&nbsp; That poor famille Roque!&nbsp; &lsquo;Oblige me
by getting rid of them,&rsquo; said Madame Cheurche&mdash;quite
as she would have asked C&eacute;lestine to remove a strong
cheese.&nbsp; She speaks as if the world were made for Madame
Cheurche.&nbsp; I hinted that if she objected to the company
there was a very simple remedy&mdash;and at present elle fait ses
paquets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really asked you to get the Rucks out of the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asked me to tell them that their rooms had been let
three months ago to another family.&nbsp; She has an
aplomb!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 414</span>Mrs.
Church&rsquo;s aplomb caused me considerable diversion; I&rsquo;m
not sure that it wasn&rsquo;t in some degree to laugh at my
leisure that I went out into the garden that evening to smoke a
cigar.&nbsp; The night was dark and not particularly balmy, and
most of my fellow pensioners, after dinner, had remained
indoors.&nbsp; A long straight walk conducted from the door of
the house to the ancient grille I&rsquo;ve described, and I stood
here for some time looking through the iron bars at the silent
empty street.&nbsp; The prospect was not enlivening and I
presently turned away.&nbsp; At this moment I saw in the distance
the door of the house open and throw a shaft of lamplight into
the darkness.&nbsp; Into the lamplight stepped the figure of an
apparently circumspect female, as they say in the old stories,
who presently closed the door behind her.&nbsp; She disappeared
in the dusk of the garden and I had seen her but an instant; yet
I remained under the impression that Aurora Church, on the eve of
departure, had come out to commune, like myself, with
isolation.</p>
<p>I lingered near the gate, keeping the red tip of my cigar
turned toward the house, and before long a slight but interesting
figure emerged from among the shadows of the trees and
encountered the rays of a lamp that stood just outside the
gate.&nbsp; My fellow solitary was in fact Aurora Church, who
acknowledged my presence with an impatience not wholly
convincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to retire&mdash;to return to the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ought,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I should be very
sorry to tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re all alone.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one
else in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time, then, that I&rsquo;ve
been alone with a young lady.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not at all
terrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I?&rdquo; she wailed to extravagance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>never</i> been alone&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Quickly, however, she interrupted herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bon,
there&rsquo;s another false note!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
415</span>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m obliged to admit that one&rsquo;s
very false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood looking at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away
to-morrow; after that there will be no one to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will matter little,&rdquo; I presently
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Telling you will do no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, why do you say that?&rdquo; she all ruefully
asked.</p>
<p>I said it partly because it was true, but I said it for other
reasons, as well, which I found hard to define.&nbsp; Standing
there bareheaded in the night air, in the vague light, this young
lady took on an extreme interest, which was moreover not
diminished by a suspicion on my own part that she had come into
the garden knowing me to be there.&nbsp; I thought her charming,
I thought her remarkable and felt very sorry for her; but as I
looked at her the terms in which Madame Beaurepas had ventured to
characterise her recurred to me with a certain force.&nbsp; I had
professed a contempt for them at the time, but it now came into
my head that perhaps this unfortunately situated, this
insidiously mutinous young creature was in quest of an effective
preserver.&nbsp; She was certainly not a girl to throw herself at
a man&rsquo;s head, but it was possible that in her
intense&mdash;her almost morbid&mdash;desire to render operative
an ideal charged perhaps after all with as many fallacies as her
mother affirmed, she might do something reckless and
irregular&mdash;something in which a sympathetic compatriot, as
yet unknown, would find his profit.&nbsp; The image, unshaped
though it was, of this sympathetic compatriot filled me with a
semblance of envy.&nbsp; For some moments I was silent, conscious
of these things; after which I answered her question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because some things&mdash;some differences&mdash;are felt,
not learned.&nbsp; To you liberty&rsquo;s not natural;
you&rsquo;re like a person who has bought a repeating watch and
is, in his satisfaction, <a name="page416"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 416</span>constantly taking it out of his
pocket to hear it sound.&nbsp; To a real American girl her
liberty&rsquo;s a very vulgarly-ticking old clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you mean then,&rdquo; said my young friend,
&ldquo;that my mother has ruined me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruined you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has so perverted my mind that when I try to be
natural I&rsquo;m necessarily indecent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw up hopeless arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;That again&rsquo;s a
false note!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re
cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I declared; &ldquo;because, for my
own taste, I prefer you as&mdash;as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my hesitating she turned back.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me a while again, and then she said in a little
reasoning tone that reminded me of her mother&rsquo;s, only that
it was conscious and studied, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that
I&rsquo;m under any particular obligation to please
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; But she also gave a clear laugh, quite at
variance with this stiffness.&nbsp; Suddenly I thought her
adorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s no obligation,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but people sometimes have preferences.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
very sorry you&rsquo;re going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter to you?&nbsp; You are going
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m going in a different direction, that makes
all the greater separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered nothing; she stood looking through the bars of
the tall gate at the empty dusky street.&nbsp; &ldquo;This grille
is like a cage,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately it&rsquo;s a cage that will
open.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I laid my hand on the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open it&rdquo;; and she pressed the gate
close.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you should open it I&rsquo;d go out.&nbsp;
There you&rsquo;d be, monsieur&mdash;for I should never
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>I
treated it as wholly thrilling, and indeed I quite found it
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where should you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow or other.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d go to the American
consul.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d beg him to give me money&mdash;to help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I received this assertion without a smile; I was not in a
smiling humour.&nbsp; On the contrary I felt singularly excited
and kept my hand on the lock of the gate.&nbsp; I believed, or I
thought I believed, what my companion said, and I
had&mdash;absurd as it may appear&mdash;an irritated vision of
her throwing herself on consular tenderness.&nbsp; It struck me
for a moment that to pass out of that gate with this yearning
straining young creature would be to pass to some mysterious
felicity.&nbsp; If I were only a hero of romance I would myself
offer to take her to America.</p>
<p>In a moment more perhaps I should have persuaded myself that I
was one, but at this juncture I heard a sound hostile to the
romantic note.&nbsp; It was nothing less than the substantial
tread of C&eacute;lestine, the cook, who stood grinning at us as
we turned about from our colloquy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask bien pardon,&rdquo; said C&eacute;lestine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The mother of mademoiselle desires that mademoiselle
should come in immediately.&nbsp; M. le Pasteur Galopin has come
to make his adieux to ces dames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurora gave me but one glance, the memory of which I
treasure.&nbsp; Then she surrendered to C&eacute;lestine, with
whom she returned to the house.</p>
<p>The next morning, on coming into the garden, I learned that
Mrs. Church and her daughter had effectively quitted us.&nbsp; I
was informed of this fact by old M. Pigeonneau, who sat there
under a tree drinking his caf&eacute;-au-lait at a little green
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to envy you,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I had the last glimpse of that charming Mees
Aurore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
418</span>&ldquo;I had a very late glimpse,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;and it was all I could possibly desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always noticed,&rdquo; rejoined M.
Pigeonneau, &ldquo;that your desires are more under control than
mine.&nbsp; Que voulez-vous?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m of the old
school.&nbsp; Je crois que cette race se perd.&nbsp; I regret the
departure of that attractive young person; she has an enchanting
smile.&nbsp; Ce sera une femme d&rsquo;esprit.&nbsp; For the
mother, I can console myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure <i>she</i>
was a femme d&rsquo;esprit, though she wished so prodigiously to
pass for one.&nbsp; Round, rosy, potel&eacute;e, she yet had not
the temperament of her appearance; she was a femme
aust&egrave;re&mdash;I made up my mind to that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
often noticed that contradiction in American ladies.&nbsp; You
see a plump little woman with a speaking eye and the contour and
complexion of a ripe peach, and if you venture to conduct
yourself in the smallest degree in accordance with these
<i>indices</i>, you discover a species of Methodist&mdash;of what
do you call it?&mdash;of Quakeress.&nbsp; On the other hand, you
encounter a tall lean angular form without colour, without grace,
all elbows and knees, and you find it&rsquo;s a nature of the
tropics!&nbsp; The women of duty look like coquettes, and the
others look like alpenstocks!&nbsp; However, we&rsquo;ve still la
belle Madame Roque&mdash;a real femme de Rubens,
celle-l&agrave;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very true that to talk to her
one must know the Flemish tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had determined in accordance with my brother&rsquo;s
telegram to go away in the afternoon; so that, having various
duties to perform, I left M. Pigeonneau to his ethnic
studies.&nbsp; Among other things I went in the course of the
morning to the banker&rsquo;s, to draw money for my journey, and
there I found Mr. Ruck with a pile of crumpled letters in his
lap, his chair tipped back and his eyes gloomily fixed on the
fringe of the green plush table-cloth.&nbsp; I timidly expressed
the hope that he had got better news from home; whereupon he <a
name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 419</span>gave me a
look in which, considering his provocation, the habit of forlorn
patience was conspicuous.</p>
<p>He took up his letters in his large hand and, crushing them
together, held it out to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;That stack of postal
matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is worth about five cents.&nbsp;
But I guess,&rdquo; he added, rising, &ldquo;that I know where I
am by this time.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I had drawn my money I asked
him to come and breakfast with me at the little brasserie, much
favoured by students, to which I used to resort in the old
town.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat, sir,&rdquo; he frankly
pleaded, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat.&nbsp; Bad disappointments
strike at the seat of the appetite.&nbsp; But I guess I&rsquo;ll
go with you, so as not to be on show down there at the
pension.&nbsp; The old woman down there accuses me of turning up
my nose at her food.&nbsp; Well, I guess I shan&rsquo;t turn up
my nose at anything now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went to the little brasserie, where poor Mr. Ruck made the
lightest possible dejeuner.&nbsp; But if he ate very little he
still moved his lean jaws&mdash;he mumbled over his spoilt repast
of apprehended facts; strange tough financial fare into which I
was unable to bite.&nbsp; I was very sorry for him, I wanted to
ease him off; but the only thing I could do when we had
breakfasted was to see him safely back to the Pension
Beaurepas.&nbsp; We went across the Treille and down the
Corraterie, out of which we turned into the Rue du
Rh&ocirc;ne.&nbsp; In this latter street, as all the world knows,
prevail those shining shop-fronts of the watchmakers and
jewellers for its long list of whom Geneva is famous.&nbsp; I had
always admired these elegant exhibitions and never passed them
without a lingering look.&nbsp; Even on this occasion,
preoccupied as I was with my impending departure and with my
companion&rsquo;s troubles, I attached my eyes to the precious
tiers that flashed and twinkled behind the huge clear plates of
glass.&nbsp; Thanks to this inveterate habit I recorded <a
name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 420</span>a fresh
observation.&nbsp; In the largest and most irresistible of these
repositories I distinguished two ladies, seated before the
counter with an air of absorption which sufficiently proclaimed
their identity.&nbsp; I hoped my companion wouldn&rsquo;t see
them, but as we came abreast of the door, a little beyond, we
found it open to the warm summer air.&nbsp; Mr. Ruck happened to
glance in, and he immediately recognised his wife and
daughter.&nbsp; He slowly stopped, his eyes fixed on them; I
wondered what he would do.&nbsp; A salesman was in the act of
holding up a bracelet before them on its velvet cushion and
flashing it about in a winsome manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck said nothing, but he presently went in; whereupon,
feeling that I mustn&rsquo;t lose him, I did the same.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be an opportunity,&rdquo; I remarked as cheerfully
as possible, &ldquo;for me to bid good-bye to the
ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned round on the approach of their relative, opposing
an indomitable front.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better get
home to breakfast&mdash;that&rsquo;s what <i>you&rsquo;d</i>
better do,&rdquo; his wife at once remarked.&nbsp; Miss Sophy
resisted in silence; she only took the bracelet from the
attendant and gazed at it all fixedly.&nbsp; My friend seated
himself on an empty stool and looked round the shop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been here before, and you ought to know
it,&rdquo; Mrs. Ruck a trifle guiltily contended.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
were here the first day we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger lady held out to me the precious object in her
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s
sweet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at it a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s
ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed her head as at a challenge to a romp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve any
taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, it&rsquo;s just too lovely,&rdquo; said her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see it some day <i>on</i> me,
anyway,&rdquo; piped Miss Ruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Ruck quietly.</p>
<p><a name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
421</span>&ldquo;It will be his own fault, then,&rdquo; Miss
Sophy returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we&rsquo;re going up to Chamouni we want to
get something here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
mayn&rsquo;t have another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband still turned his eyes over the shop, whistling
half under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t going up to
Chamouni.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going back to New York City
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; she made
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose we want to take
something home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going straight back I must have that
bracelet,&rdquo; her daughter declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only I
don&rsquo;t want a velvet case; I want a satin case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must bid you good-bye,&rdquo; I observed all
irrelevantly to the ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving Geneva
in an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a good look at that bracelet, so you&rsquo;ll know
it when you see it,&rdquo; was hereupon Miss Sophy&rsquo;s form
of farewell to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bound to have something!&rdquo; her mother
almost proudly attested.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruck still vaguely examined the shop; he still just
audibly whistled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s not at
all well,&rdquo; I took occasion to intimate to his wife.</p>
<p>She twisted her head a little and glanced at him; she had a
brief but pregnant pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I must say I wish
he&rsquo;d improve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A satin case, and a nice one!&rdquo; cried Miss Ruck to
the shopman.</p>
<p>I bade her other parent good-bye.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
wait for me,&rdquo; he said, sitting there on his stool and not
meeting my eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see this thing
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went back to the Pension Beaurepas, and when an hour later I
left it with my luggage these interesting friends had not
returned.</p>

BUNDLE OF LETTERS</h2>
<h3><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 425</span>I<br
/>
FROM MISS MIRANDA HOPE IN PARIS TO MRS. ABRAHAM C. HOPE AT BANGOR
MAINE</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 5, 1879.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept you posted as far as Tuesday week last, and
though my letter won&rsquo;t have reached you yet I&rsquo;ll
begin another before my news accumulates too much.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m glad you show my letters round in the family, for I
like them all to know what I&rsquo;m doing, and I can&rsquo;t
write to every one, even if I do try to answer all reasonable
expectations.&nbsp; There are a great many unreasonable ones, as
I suppose you know&mdash;not yours, dear mother, for I&rsquo;m
bound to say that you never required of me more than was
natural.&nbsp; You see you&rsquo;re reaping your reward: I write
to you before I write to any one else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing I hope&mdash;that you don&rsquo;t show
any of my letters to William Platt.&nbsp; If he wants to see any
of my letters he knows the right way to go to work.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t have him see one of these letters, written for
circulation in the family, for anything in the world.&nbsp; If he
wants one for himself he has got to write to me first.&nbsp; Let
him write to me first and then I&rsquo;ll see about answering
him.&nbsp; You can show him this if you like; but if you show him
anything more I&rsquo;ll never write to you again.</p>
<p><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>I
told you in my last about my farewell to England, my crossing the
Channel and my first impressions of Paris.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
thought a great deal about that lovely England since I left it,
and all the famous historic scenes I visited; but I&rsquo;ve come
to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s not a country in which I should
care to reside.&nbsp; The position of woman doesn&rsquo;t seem to
me at all satisfactory, and that&rsquo;s a point, you know, on
which I feel very strongly.&nbsp; It seems to me that in England
they play a very faded-out part, and those with whom I conversed
had a kind of downtrodden tone, a spiritless and even benighted
air, as if they were used to being snubbed and bullied <i>and as
if they liked it</i>, which made me want to give them a good
shaking.&nbsp; There are a great many people&mdash;and a great
many things too&mdash;over here that I should like to get at for
that purpose.&nbsp; I should like to shake the starch out of some
of them and the dust out of the others.&nbsp; I know fifty girls
in Bangor that come much more up to my notion of the stand a
truly noble woman should take than those young ladies in
England.&nbsp; But they had the sweetest way of speaking, as if
it were a second nature, and the men are <i>remarkably
handsome</i>.&nbsp; (You can show <i>that</i> to William Platt if
you like.)</p>
<p>I gave you my first impressions of Paris, which quite came up
to my expectations, much as I had heard and read about it.&nbsp;
The objects of interest are extremely numerous, and the climate
remarkably cheerful and sunny.&nbsp; I should say the position of
woman here was considerably higher, though by no means up to the
American standard.&nbsp; The manners of the people are in some
respects extremely peculiar, and I feel at last that I&rsquo;m
indeed in <i>foreign parts</i>.&nbsp; It is, however, a truly
elegant city (much more majestic than New York) and I&rsquo;ve
spent a great deal of time in visiting the various monuments and
palaces.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t give you an account of all my
wanderings, <a name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
427</span>though I&rsquo;ve been most indefatigable; for
I&rsquo;m keeping, as I told you before, a most <i>exhaustive</i>
journal, which I&rsquo;ll allow you the <i>privilege</i> of
reading on my return to Bangor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m getting on
remarkably well, and I must say I&rsquo;m sometimes surprised at
my universal good fortune.&nbsp; It only shows what a little
Bangor energy and gumption will accomplish wherever
applied.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve discovered none of those objections to
a young lady travelling in Europe by herself of which we heard so
much before I left, and I don&rsquo;t expect I ever shall, for I
certainly don&rsquo;t mean to look for them.&nbsp; I know what I
want and I always go straight for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received a great deal of politeness&mdash;some of
it really most pressing, and have experienced no drawbacks
whatever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made a great many pleasant
acquaintances in travelling round&mdash;both ladies and
gentlemen&mdash;and had a great many interesting and
open-hearted, if quite informal, talks.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
collected a great many remarkable facts&mdash;I guess we
don&rsquo;t know quite <i>everything</i> at Bangor&mdash;for
which I refer you to my journal.&nbsp; I assure you my
journal&rsquo;s going to be a splendid picture of an earnest
young life.&nbsp; I do just exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find
I do perfectly right.&nbsp; At any rate I don&rsquo;t care if I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t come to Europe to lead a merely
conventional society life: I could do that at Bangor.&nbsp; You
know I never <i>would</i> do it at Bangor, so it isn&rsquo;t
likely I&rsquo;m going to worship false gods over here.&nbsp; So
long as I accomplish what I desire and make my money hold out I
shall regard the thing as a success.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel
rather lonely, especially evenings; but I generally manage to
interest myself in something or in some one.&nbsp; I mostly read
up, evenings, on the objects of interest I&rsquo;ve visited
during the day, or put in time on my journal.&nbsp; Sometimes I
go to the theatre or else play the piano in the public
parlour.&nbsp; The <a name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
428</span>public parlour at the hotel isn&rsquo;t much; but the
piano&rsquo;s better than that fearful old thing at the Sebago
House.&nbsp; Sometimes I go downstairs and talk to the lady who
keeps the books&mdash;a real French lady, who&rsquo;s remarkably
polite.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very handsome, though in the peculiar
French way, and always wears a black dress of the most beautiful
fit.&nbsp; She speaks a little English; she tells me she had to
learn it in order to converse with the Americans who come in such
numbers to this hotel.&nbsp; She has given me lots of points on
the position of woman in France, and seems to think that on the
whole there&rsquo;s hope.&nbsp; But she has told me at the same
time some things I shouldn&rsquo;t like to write to
you&mdash;I&rsquo;m hesitating even about putting them into my
journal&mdash;especially if my letters are to be handed round in
the family.&nbsp; I assure you they appear to talk about things
here that we never think of mentioning at Bangor, even to
ourselves or to our very closest; and it has struck me that
people are closer&mdash;to each other&mdash;down in Maine than
seems mostly to be expected here.&nbsp; This bright-minded lady
appears at any rate to think she can tell me everything because
I&rsquo;ve told her I&rsquo;m travelling for general
culture.&nbsp; Well, I <i>do</i> want to know so much that it
seems sometimes as if I wanted to know most everything; and yet I
guess there are some things that don&rsquo;t count for
improvement.&nbsp; But as a general thing everything&rsquo;s
intensely interesting; I don&rsquo;t mean only everything this
charming woman tells me, but everything I see and hear for
myself.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll come out where I want.</p>
<p>I meet a great many Americans who, as a general thing, I must
say, are not so polite to me as the people over here.&nbsp; The
people over here&mdash;especially the gentlemen&mdash;are much
more what I should call almost oppressively attentive.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether Americans are more truly sincere; I
haven&rsquo;t yet made <a name="page429"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 429</span>up my mind about that.&nbsp; The
only drawback I experience is when Americans sometimes express
surprise that I should be travelling round alone; so you see it
doesn&rsquo;t come from Europeans.&nbsp; I always have my answer
ready: &ldquo;For general culture, to acquire the languages and
to see Europe for myself&rdquo;; and that generally seems to calm
them.&nbsp; Dear mother, my money holds out very well, and it is
real interesting.</p>
<h3><a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
430</span>II<br />
FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 16.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you I&rsquo;ve left that nice hotel and
come to live in a French family&mdash;which, however, is nice
too.&nbsp; This place is a kind of boarding-house that&rsquo;s at
the same time a kind of school; only it&rsquo;s not like an
American boarding-house, nor like an American school
either.&nbsp; There are four or five people here that have come
to learn the language&mdash;not to take lessons, but to have an
opportunity for conversation.&nbsp; I was very glad to come to
such a place, for I had begun to realise that I wasn&rsquo;t
pressing onward quite as I had dreamed with the French.&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t I going to feel ashamed to have spent two months in
Paris and not to have acquired more insight into the
language?&nbsp; I had always heard so much of French
conversation, and I found I wasn&rsquo;t having much more
opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at
Bangor.&nbsp; In fact I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor
from those French-Canadians who came down to cut the ice than I
saw I should ever hear at that nice hotel where was no
struggle&mdash;<i>some</i> fond struggle being my real
atmosphere.&nbsp; The lady who kept the books seemed to want so
much to talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I
suppose)&mdash;she kind of yearned to struggle too: we
don&rsquo;t yearn <i>only</i> down in <a name="page431"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 431</span>Maine&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t
bear to show her I didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; The chambermaid
was Irish and all the waiters German, so I never heard a word of
French spoken.&nbsp; I suppose you might hear a great deal in the
shops; but as I don&rsquo;t buy anything&mdash;I prefer to spend
my money for purposes of culture&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have that
advantage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking some of taking a teacher, but am well
acquainted with the grammar already, and over here in Europe
teachers don&rsquo;t seem to think it&rsquo;s <i>really</i> in
their interest to let you press forward.&nbsp; The more you
strike out and realise your power the less they&rsquo;ve got to
teach you.&nbsp; I was a good deal troubled anyhow, for I felt as
if I didn&rsquo;t want to go away without having at least got a
general idea of French conversation.&nbsp; The theatre gives you
a good deal of insight, and as I told you in my last I go a good
deal to the brightest places of amusement.&nbsp; I find no
difficulty whatever in going to such places alone, and am always
treated with the politeness which, as I&rsquo;ve
mentioned&mdash;for I want you to feel happy about that&mdash;I
encounter everywhere from the best people.&nbsp; I see plenty of
other ladies alone (mostly French) and they generally seem to be
enjoying themselves as much as I.&nbsp; Only on the stage every
one talks so fast that I can scarcely make out what they say;
and, besides, there are a great many vulgar expressions which
it&rsquo;s unnecessary to learn.&nbsp; But it was this experience
nevertheless that put me on the track.&nbsp; The very next day
after I wrote to you last I went to the Palais Royal, which is
one of the principal theatres in Paris.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
small but very celebrated, and in my guide-book it&rsquo;s marked
with <i>two stars</i>, which is a sign of importance attached
only to <i>first-class</i> objects of interest.&nbsp; But after I
had been there half an hour I found I couldn&rsquo;t understand a
single word of the play, they gabbled it off so fast and made use
of such <a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
432</span>peculiar expressions.&nbsp; I felt a good deal
disappointed and checked&mdash;I saw I wasn&rsquo;t going to come
out where I had dreamed.&nbsp; But while I was thinking it
over&mdash;thinking what I <i>would</i> do&mdash;I heard two
gentlemen talking behind me.&nbsp; It was between the acts, and I
couldn&rsquo;t help listening to what they said.&nbsp; They were
talking English, but I guess they were Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;it all depends on
what you&rsquo;re after.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m after French;
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after
Art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after Art
too; but I&rsquo;m after French most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, dear mother, I&rsquo;m sorry to say the second one swore
a little.&nbsp; He said &ldquo;Oh damn French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t damn French,&rdquo; said his
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll acquire it&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ll do with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go right into a
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What family&rsquo;ll you go into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into some nice French family.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
only way to do&mdash;to go to some place where you can
talk.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re after Art you want to stick to the
galleries; you want to go right through the Louvre, room by room;
you want to take a room a day, or something of that sort.&nbsp;
But if you want to acquire French the thing is to look out for
some family that has got&mdash;and they mostly have&mdash;more of
it than they&rsquo;ve use for themselves.&nbsp; How <i>can</i>
they have use for so much as they seem to <i>have</i> to
have?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got to work it off.&nbsp; Well, they
work it off on <i>you</i>.&nbsp; There are lots of them that take
you to board and teach you.&nbsp; My second cousin&mdash;that
young lady I told you about&mdash;she got in with a crowd like
that, and they posted her right up in three months.&nbsp; They
just took her right in and let her have it&mdash;the full
force.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what they do to you; they set you right
down and they talk <i>at</i> <a name="page433"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 433</span>you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to
understand them or perish&mdash;so you strike out in
self-defence; you can&rsquo;t help yourself.&nbsp; That family my
cousin was with has moved away somewhere, or I should try and get
in with them.&nbsp; They were real live people, that family;
after she left my cousin corresponded with them in French.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got to do <i>that</i> too, to make much real
head.&nbsp; But I mean to find some other crowd, if it takes a
lot of trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened to all this with great interest, and when he spoke
about his cousin I was on the point of turning around to ask him
the address of the family she was with; but the next moment he
said they had moved away, so I sat still.&nbsp; The other
gentleman, however, didn&rsquo;t seem to be affected in the same
way as I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may follow up that if
you like; I mean to follow up the pictures.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s ever going to be any considerable demand in
the United States for French; but I can promise you that in about
ten years there&rsquo;ll be a big demand for Art!&nbsp; And it
won&rsquo;t be temporary either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That remark may be very true, but I don&rsquo;t care anything
about the demand; I want to know French for its own sake.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Art for art,&rdquo; they say; but I say French for
French.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to think I&rsquo;ve been all
this while without having gained an insight. . . .&nbsp; The very
next day, I asked the lady who kept the books at the hotel
whether she knew of any family that could take me to board and
give me the benefit of their conversation.&nbsp; She instantly
threw up her hands with little shrill cries&mdash;in their
wonderful French way, you know&mdash;and told me that her dearest
friend kept a regular place of that kind.&nbsp; If she had known
I was looking out for such a place she would have told me before;
she hadn&rsquo;t spoken of it herself because she didn&rsquo;t
wish to injure the hotel by working <a name="page434"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 434</span>me off on another house.&nbsp; She
told me this was a charming family who had often received
American ladies&mdash;and others, including three
Tahitans&mdash;who wished to follow up the language, and she was
sure I&rsquo;d fall in love with them.&nbsp; So she gave me their
address and offered to go with me to introduce me.&nbsp; But I
was in such a hurry that I went off by myself and soon found them
all right.&nbsp; They were sitting there as if they kind of
expected me, and wouldn&rsquo;t scarcely let me come round again
for my baggage.&nbsp; They seemed to have right there on hand, as
those gentlemen of the theatre said, plenty of what I was after,
and I now feel there&rsquo;ll be no trouble about
<i>that</i>.</p>
<p>I came here to stay about three days ago, and by this time
I&rsquo;ve quite worked in.&nbsp; The price of board struck me as
rather high, but I must remember what a chance to press onward it
includes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a very pretty little
room&mdash;without any carpet, but with seven mirrors, two clocks
and five curtains.&nbsp; I was rather disappointed, however,
after I arrived, to find that there are several other Americans
here&mdash;all also bent on pressing onward.&nbsp; At least there
are three American and two English pensioners, as they call them,
as well as a German gentleman&mdash;and there seems nothing
backward about <i>him</i>.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
we&rsquo;d make a regular class, with &ldquo;moving up&rdquo; and
moving down; anyhow I guess I won&rsquo;t be at the foot, but
I&rsquo;ve not yet time to judge.&nbsp; I try to talk with Madame
de Maisonrouge all I can&mdash;she&rsquo;s the lady of the house,
and the <i>real</i> family consists only of herself and her two
daughters.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re bright enough to give points to
our own brightest, and I guess we&rsquo;ll become quite
intimate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write you more about everything in my
next.&nbsp; Tell William Platt I don&rsquo;t care a speck
<i>what</i> he does.</p>

435</span>III<br />
FROM MISS VIOLET RAY IN PARIS TO MISS AGNES RICH IN NEW YORK</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 21.</p>
<p>We had hardly got here when father received a telegram saying
he would have to come right back to New York.&nbsp; It was for
something about his business&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know exactly
what; you know I never understand those things and never want
to.&nbsp; We had just got settled at the hotel, in some charming
rooms, and mother and I, as you may imagine, were greatly
annoyed.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s extremely fussy, as you know, and
his first idea, as soon as he found he should have to go back,
was that we should go back with him.&nbsp; He declared he&rsquo;d
never leave us in Paris alone and that we must return and come
out again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what he thought would happen
to us; I suppose he thought we should be too extravagant.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s theory that we&rsquo;re always
running-up bills, whereas a little observation would show him
that we wear the same old <i>rags</i> <span class="smcap">for
months</span>.&nbsp; But father has no observation; he has
nothing but blind theories.&nbsp; Mother and I, however, have
fortunately a great deal of <i>practice</i>, and we succeeded in
making him understand that we wouldn&rsquo;t budge from Paris and
that we&rsquo;d rather be chopped into small pieces than cross
that squalid sea again.&nbsp; So at last he decided to go back <a
name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 436</span>alone and
to leave us here for three months.&nbsp; Only, to show you how
fussy he is, he refused to let us stay at the hotel and insisted
that we should go into a <i>family</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what put such an idea into his head unless it was some
advertisement that he saw in one of the American papers that are
published here.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think you can escape from them
anywhere.</p>
<p>There are families here who receive American and English
people to live with them under the pretence of teaching them
French.&nbsp; You may imagine what people they are&mdash;I mean
the families themselves.&nbsp; But the Americans who choose this
peculiar manner of seeing Paris must be actually just as
bad.&nbsp; Mother and I were horrified&mdash;we declared that
<i>main force</i> shouldn&rsquo;t remove us from the hotel.&nbsp;
But father has a way of arriving at his ends which is more
effective than violence.&nbsp; He worries and goes on; he
&ldquo;nags,&rdquo; as we used to say at school; and when mother
and I are quite worn to the bone his triumph is assured.&nbsp;
Mother&rsquo;s more quickly ground down than I, and she ends by
siding with father; so that at last when they combine their
forces against poor little me I&rsquo;ve naturally to
succumb.&nbsp; You should have heard the way father went on about
this &ldquo;family&rdquo; plan; he talked to every one he saw
about it; he used to go round to the banker&rsquo;s and talk to
the people there&mdash;the people in the post-office; he used to
try and exchange ideas about it with the waiters at the
hotel.&nbsp; He said it would be more safe, more respectable,
more economical; that I should pick up more French; that mother
would learn how a French household&rsquo;s conducted; that he
should feel more easy, and that we ourselves should enjoy it when
we came to see.&nbsp; All this meant nothing, but that made no
difference.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s positively cruel his harping on our
pinching and saving when every one knows that business in America
has completely recovered, that the prostration&rsquo;s all over
and <a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 437</span>that
<i>immense fortunes</i> are being made.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been
depriving ourselves of the commonest necessities for the last
five years, and I supposed we came abroad to reap the benefits of
it.</p>
<p>As for my French it&rsquo;s already much better than that of
most of our helpless compatriots, who are all unblushingly
destitute of the very rudiments.&nbsp; (I assure you I&rsquo;m
often surprised at my own fluency, and when I get a little more
practice in the circumflex accents and the genders and the idioms
I shall quite hold my own.)&nbsp; To make a long story short,
however, father carried his point as usual; mother basely
deserted me at the last moment, and after holding out alone for
three days I told them to do with me what they would.&nbsp;
Father lost three steamers in succession by remaining in Paris to
argue with me.&nbsp; You know he&rsquo;s like the schoolmaster in
Goldsmith&rsquo;s <i>Deserted Village</i>&mdash;&ldquo;e&rsquo;en
though vanquished&rdquo; he always argues still.&nbsp; He and
mother went to look at some seventeen families&mdash;they had got
the addresses somewhere&mdash;while I retired to my sofa and
would have nothing to do with it.&nbsp; At last they made
arrangements and I was transported, as in chains, to the
establishment from which I now write you.&nbsp; I address you
from the bosom of a Parisian m&eacute;nage&mdash;from the depths
of a second-rate boarding-house.</p>
<p>Father only left Paris after he had seen us what he calls
comfortably settled here and had informed Madame de
Maisonrouge&mdash;the mistress of the establishment, the head of
the &ldquo;family&rdquo;&mdash;that he wished my French
pronunciation especially attended to.&nbsp; The pronunciation, as
it happens, is just what I&rsquo;m most at home in; if he had
said my genders or my subjunctives or my idioms there would have
been some sense.&nbsp; But poor father has no native tact, and
this deficiency has become flagrant since we&rsquo;ve been in
Europe.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be absent, however, for three <a
name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 438</span>months, and
mother and I shall breathe more freely; the situation will be
less tense.&nbsp; I must confess that we breathe more freely than
I expected in this place, where we&rsquo;ve been about a
week.&nbsp; I was sure before we came that it would prove to be
an establishment of the <i>lowest description</i>; but I must say
that in this respect I&rsquo;m agreeably disappointed.&nbsp; The
French spirit is able to throw a sort of grace even over a
swindle of this general order.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s very
disagreeable to live with strangers, but as, after all, if I
weren&rsquo;t staying with Madame de Maisonrouge I
shouldn&rsquo;t be <i>vautr&eacute;e</i> in the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, I don&rsquo;t know that from the point of view of
exclusiveness I&rsquo;m much the loser.</p>
<p>Our rooms are very prettily arranged and the table&rsquo;s
remarkably good.&nbsp; Mamma thinks the whole thing&mdash;the
place and the people, the manners and customs&mdash;very amusing;
but mamma can be put off with any imposture.&nbsp; As for me, you
know, all that I ask is to be let alone and not to have
people&rsquo;s society <i>forced upon me</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
never wanted for society of my own choosing, and, so long as I
retain possession of my faculties, I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever
shall.&nbsp; As I said, however, the place seems to scramble
along, and I succeed in doing as I please, which, you know, is my
most cherished pursuit.&nbsp; Madame de Maisonrouge has a great
deal of tact&mdash;much more than poor floundering father.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s what they call here a <i>grande belle femme</i>,
which means that she&rsquo;s high-shouldered and short-necked and
literally hideous, but with a certain quantity of false
type.&nbsp; She has a good many clothes, some rather bad; but a
very good manner&mdash;only one, and worked to death, but
intended to be of the best.&nbsp; Though she&rsquo;s a very good
imitation of a <i>femme du monde</i> I never see her behind the
dinner-table in the evening, never see her smile and bow and duck
as the people come in, really glaring all the <a
name="page439"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 439</span>while at
the dishes and the servants, without thinking of a <i>dame de
comptoir</i> blooming in a corner of a shop or a
restaurant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that in spite of her <i>beau
nom</i> she was once a paid book-keeper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m also
sure that in spite of her smiles and the pretty things she says
to every one, she hates us all and would like to murder us.&nbsp;
She is a hard clever Frenchwoman who would like to amuse herself
and enjoy her Paris, and she must be furious at having to pass
her time grinning at specimens of the stupid races who mumble
broken French at her.&nbsp; Some day she&rsquo;ll poison the soup
or the <i>vin rouge</i>, but I hope that won&rsquo;t be until
after mother and I shall have left her.&nbsp; She has two
daughters who, except that one&rsquo;s decidedly pretty, are
meagre imitations of herself.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;family,&rdquo; for the rest, consists altogether of
our beloved compatriots and of still more beloved
Englanders.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an Englander with his sister, and
they seem rather decent.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s remarkably handsome,
but excessively affected and patronising, especially to us
Americans; and I hope to have a chance of biting his head off
before long.&nbsp; The sister&rsquo;s very pretty and apparently
very nice, but in costume Britannia incarnate.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a very pleasant little Frenchman&mdash;when
they&rsquo;re nice they&rsquo;re charming&mdash;and a German
doctor, a big blond man who looks like a great white bull; and
two Americans besides mother and me.&nbsp; One of them&rsquo;s a
young man from Boston&mdash;an esthetic young man who talks about
its being &ldquo;a real Corot day,&rdquo; and a young
woman&mdash;a girl, a female, I don&rsquo;t know what to call
her&mdash;from Vermont or Minnesota or some such place.&nbsp;
This young woman&rsquo;s the most extraordinary specimen of
self-complacent provinciality that I&rsquo;ve ever encountered;
she&rsquo;s really too horrible and too humiliating.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been three times to Cl&eacute;mentine about your
underskirt, etc.</p>

FROM LOUIS LEVERETT IN PARIS TO HARVARD TREMONT IN BOSTON</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 25.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Harvard</span>,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve carried out my plan, of which I gave you a hint in
my last, and I only regret I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it
before.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s human nature, after all, that&rsquo;s
the most interesting thing in the world, and it only reveals
itself to the truly earnest seeker.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a want of
earnestness in that life of hotels and railroad-trains which so
many of our countrymen are content to lead in this strange rich
elder world, and I was distressed to find how far I myself had
been led along the dusty beaten track.&nbsp; I had, however,
constantly wanted to turn aside into more unfrequented
ways&mdash;to plunge beneath the surface and see what I should
discover.&nbsp; But the opportunity had always been missing;
somehow I seem never to meet those opportunities that we hear
about and read about&mdash;the things that happen to people in
novels and biographies.&nbsp; And yet I&rsquo;m always on the
watch to take advantage of any opening that may present itself;
I&rsquo;m always looking out for experiences, for
sensations&mdash;I might almost say for adventures.</p>
<p>The great thing is to <i>live</i>, you know&mdash;to feel, to
be conscious of one&rsquo;s possibilities; not to pass through <a
name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 441</span>life
mechanically and insensibly, even as a letter through the
post-office.&nbsp; There are times, my dear Harvard, when I feel
as if I were really capable of everything&mdash;<i>capable de
tout</i>, as they say here&mdash;of the greatest excesses as well
as the greatest heroism.&nbsp; Oh to be able to say that one has
lived&mdash;<i>qu&rsquo;on a v&eacute;cu</i>, as they say
here&mdash;that idea exercises an indefinable attraction for
me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll perhaps reply that nothing&rsquo;s easier
than to say it!&nbsp; Only the thing&rsquo;s to make people
believe you&mdash;to make above all one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; And
then I don&rsquo;t want any second-hand spurious sensations; I
want the knowledge that leaves a trace&mdash;that leaves strange
scars and stains, ineffable reveries and aftertastes, behind
it!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afraid I shock you, perhaps even frighten
you.</p>
<p>If you repeat my remarks to any of the West Cedar Street
circle be sure you tone them down as your discretion will
suggest.&nbsp; For yourself you&rsquo;ll know that I have always
had an intense desire to see something of <i>real French
life</i>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re acquainted with my great sympathy
with the French; with my natural tendency to enter into their so
supremely fine exploitation of the whole personal
consciousness.&nbsp; I sympathise with the artistic temperament;
I remember you used sometimes to hint to me that you thought my
own temperament <i>too</i> artistic.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t consider
that in Boston there&rsquo;s any real sympathy with the artistic
temperament; we tend to make everything a matter of right and
wrong.&nbsp; And in Boston one can&rsquo;t
<i>live</i>&mdash;<i>on ne peut pas vivre</i>, as they say
here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean one can&rsquo;t reside&mdash;for a
great many people manage that; but one can&rsquo;t live
esthetically&mdash;I almost venture to say one can&rsquo;t live
sensuously.&nbsp; This is why I&rsquo;ve always been so much
drawn to the French, who are so esthetic, so sensuous, so
<i>entirely</i> living.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so sorry dear
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier has passed away; I should have liked so
much to go <a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
442</span>and see him and tell him all I owe him.&nbsp; He was
living when I was here before; but, you know, at that time I was
travelling with the Johnsons, who are not esthetic and who used
to make me feel rather ashamed of my love and my need of
beauty.&nbsp; If I had gone to see the great apostle of that
religion I should have had to go clandestinely&mdash;<i>en
cachette</i>, as they say here; and that&rsquo;s not my nature; I
like to do everything frankly, freely, <i>na&iuml;vement, au
grand jour</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the great thing&mdash;to be
free, to be frank, to be na&iuml;f.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t Matthew
Arnold say that somewhere&mdash;or is it Swinburne or Pater?</p>
<p>When I was with the Johnsons everything was superficial, and,
as regards life, everything was brought down to the question of
right and wrong.&nbsp; They were eternally didactic; art should
never be didactic; and what&rsquo;s life but the finest of
arts?&nbsp; Pater has said that so well somewhere.&nbsp; With the
Johnsons I&rsquo;m afraid I lost many opportunities; the whole
outlook or at least the whole medium&mdash;of feeling, of
appreciation&mdash;was grey and cottony, I might almost say
woolly.&nbsp; Now, however, as I tell you, I&rsquo;ve determined
to take right hold for myself; to look right into European life
and judge it without Johnsonian prejudices.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
taken up my residence in a French family, in a real Parisian
house.&nbsp; You see I&rsquo;ve the courage of my opinions; I
don&rsquo;t shrink from carrying out my theory that the great
thing is to <i>live</i>.</p>
<p>You know I&rsquo;ve always been intensely interested in
Balzac, who never shrank from the reality and whose almost
<i>lurid</i> pictures of Parisian life have often haunted me in
my wanderings through the old wicked-looking streets on the other
side of the river.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only sorry that my new
friends&mdash;my French family&mdash;don&rsquo;t live in the old
city, <i>au cour de vieux Paris</i>, as they say here.&nbsp; They
live only on the Boulevard Haussmann, which is a compromise, but
in spite of <a name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
443</span>this they have a great deal of the Balzac tone.&nbsp;
Madame de Maisonrouge belongs to one of the oldest and proudest
families in France, but has had reverses which have compelled her
to open an establishment in which a limited number of travellers,
who are weary of the beaten track, who shun the great
caravanseries, who cherish the tradition of the old French
sociability&mdash;she explains it herself, she expresses it so
well&mdash;in short to open a &ldquo;select&rdquo;
boarding-house.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t
after all use that expression, for it&rsquo;s the correlative of
the term pension bourgeoise, employed by Balzac in <i>Le
P&egrave;re Goriot</i>.&nbsp; Do you remember the pension
bourgeoise of Madame Vauquer n&eacute;e de Conflans?&nbsp; But
this establishment isn&rsquo;t at all like that, and indeed
isn&rsquo;t bourgeois at all; I don&rsquo;t quite know how the
machinery of selection operates, but we unmistakably feel
we&rsquo;re select.&nbsp; The Pension Vauquer was dark, brown,
sordid, graisseuse; but this is in quite a different tone, with
high clear lightly-draped windows and several rather good Louis
Seize pieces&mdash;family heirlooms, Madame de Maisonrouge
explains.&nbsp; She recalls to me Madame Hulot&mdash;do you
remember &ldquo;la belle Madame Hulot&rdquo;?&mdash;in <i>Les
Parents Pauvres</i>.&nbsp; She has a great charm&mdash;though a
little artificial, a little jaded and faded, with a suggestion of
hidden things in her life.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve always been
sensitive to the seduction of an ambiguous fatigue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rather disappointed, I confess, in the society I
find here; it isn&rsquo;t so richly native, of so indigenous a
note, as I could have desired.&nbsp; Indeed, to tell the truth,
it&rsquo;s not native at all; though on the other hand it
<i>is</i> furiously cosmopolite, and that speaks to me too at my
hours.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re French <i>and</i> we&rsquo;re English;
we&rsquo;re American <i>and</i> we&rsquo;re German; I believe too
there are some Spaniards and some Hungarians expected.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m much interested in the study of racial <a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>types; in
comparing, contrasting, seizing the strong points, the weak
points, in identifying, however muffled by social hypocrisy, the
sharp keynote of each.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s interesting to shift
one&rsquo;s point of view, to despoil one&rsquo;s self of
one&rsquo;s idiotic prejudices, to enter into strange exotic ways
of looking at life.</p>
<p>The American types don&rsquo;t, I much regret to say, make a
strong or rich affirmation, and, excepting my own (and what
<i>is</i> my own, dear Harvard, I ask you?), are wholly negative
and feminine.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re <i>thin</i>&mdash;that I should
have to say it! we&rsquo;re pale, we&rsquo;re poor, we&rsquo;re
flat.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something meagre about us; our line is
wanting in roundness, our composition in richness.&nbsp; We lack
temperament; we don&rsquo;t know how to live; <i>nous ne savons
pas vivre</i>, as they say here.&nbsp; The American temperament
is represented&mdash;putting myself aside, and I often think that
my temperament isn&rsquo;t at all American&mdash;by a young girl
and her mother and by another young girl without her mother,
without either parent or any attendant or appendage
whatever.&nbsp; These inevitable creatures are more or less in
the picture; they have a certain interest, they have a certain
stamp, but they&rsquo;re disappointing too: they don&rsquo;t go
far; they don&rsquo;t keep all they promise; they don&rsquo;t
satisfy the imagination.&nbsp; They are cold slim sexless; the
physique&rsquo;s not generous, not abundant; it&rsquo;s only the
drapery, the skirts and furbelows&mdash;that is, I mean in the
young lady who has her mother&mdash;that are abundant.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re rather different&mdash;we <i>have</i> our little
differences, thank God: one of them all elegance, all &ldquo;paid
bills&rdquo; and extra-fresh <i>gants de Su&egrave;de</i>, from
New York; the other a plain pure clear-eyed narrow-chested
straight-stepping maiden from the heart of New England.&nbsp; And
yet they&rsquo;re very much alike too&mdash;more alike than they
would care to think themselves; for they face each other with
scarcely disguised opposition and disavowal.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
<a name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>both
specimens of the practical positive passionless young thing as we
let her loose on the world&mdash;and yet with a certain fineness
and knowing, as you please, either too much or too little.&nbsp;
With all of which, as I say, they have their spontaneity and even
their oddity; though no more mystery, either of them, than the
printed circular thrust into your hand on the street-corner.</p>
<p>The little New Yorker&rsquo;s sometimes very amusing; she asks
me if every one in Boston talks like me&mdash;if every
one&rsquo;s as &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; as your poor
correspondent.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s for ever throwing Boston up at
me; I can&rsquo;t get rid of poor dear little Boston.&nbsp; The
other one rubs it into me too, but in a different way; she seems
to feel about it as a good Mahommedan feels toward Mecca, and
regards it as a focus of light for the whole human race.&nbsp;
Yes, poor little Boston, what nonsense is talked in thy
name!&nbsp; But this New England maiden is in her way a rare
white flower; she&rsquo;s travelling all over Europe
alone&mdash;&ldquo;to see it,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;for
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; For herself!&nbsp; What can that strangely
serene self of hers do with such sights, such depths!&nbsp; She
looks at everything, goes everywhere, passes her way with her
clear quiet eyes wide open; skirting the edge of obscene abysses
without suspecting them; pushing through brambles without tearing
her robe; exciting, without knowing it, the most injurious
suspicions; and always holding her course&mdash;without a stain,
without a sense, without a fear, without a charm!</p>
<p>Then by way of contrast there&rsquo;s a lovely English girl
with eyes as shy as violets and a voice as sweet!&mdash;the
difference between the printed, the distributed, the gratuitous
hand-bill and the shy scrap of a <i>billet-doux</i> dropped where
you may pick it up.&nbsp; She has a sweet Gainsborough head and a
great Gainsborough hat with a mighty plume in front of it that
makes <a name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 446</span>a
shadow over her quiet English eyes.&nbsp; Then she has a
sage-green robe, &ldquo;mystic wonderful,&rdquo; all embroidered
with subtle devices and flowers, with birds and beasts of tender
tint; very straight and tight in front and adorned behind, along
the spine, with large strange iridescent buttons.&nbsp; The
revival of taste, of the sense of beauty, in England, interests
me deeply; what is there in a simple row of spinal buttons to
make one dream&mdash;to <i>donner &agrave; r&ecirc;ver</i>, as
they say here?&nbsp; I believe a grand esthetic renascence to be
at hand and that a great light will be kindled in England for all
the world to see.&nbsp; There are spirits there I should like to
commune with; I think they&rsquo;d understand me.</p>
<p>This gracious English maiden, with her clinging robes, her
amulets and girdles, with something quaint and angular in her
step, her carriage, something medieval and Gothic in the details
of her person and dress, this lovely Evelyn Vane (isn&rsquo;t it
a beautiful name?) exhales association and implication.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s so much a woman&mdash;<i>elle est bien femme</i>, as
they say here; simpler softer rounder richer than the easy
products I spoke of just now.&nbsp; Not much talk&mdash;a great
sweet silence.&nbsp; Then the violet eye&mdash;the very eye
itself seems to blush; the great shadowy hat making the brow so
quiet; the strange clinging clutched pictured raiment!&nbsp; As I
say, it&rsquo;s a very gracious tender type.&nbsp; She has her
brother with her, who&rsquo;s a beautiful fair-haired grey-eyed
young Englishman.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s purely objective, but he too
is very plastic.</p>

FROM MIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 26.</p>
<p>You mustn&rsquo;t be frightened at not hearing from me
oftener; it isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m in any trouble, but
because I&rsquo;m getting on so well.&nbsp; If I were in any
trouble I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d write to you; I&rsquo;d
just keep quiet and see it through myself.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
not the case at present; and if I don&rsquo;t write to you
it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m so deeply interested over here that
I don&rsquo;t seem to find time.&nbsp; It was a real providence
that brought me to this house, where, in spite of all obstacles,
I <i>am</i> able to press onward.&nbsp; I wonder how I find time
for all I do, but when I realise I&rsquo;ve only got about a year
left, all told, I feel as if I wouldn&rsquo;t sacrifice a single
hour.</p>
<p>The obstacles I refer to are the disadvantages I have in
acquiring the language, there being so many persons round me
speaking English, and that, as you may say, in the very bosom of
a regular French family.&nbsp; It seems as if you heard English
everywhere; but I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect to find it in a
place like this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not discouraged, however, and I
exercise all I can, even with the other English boarders.&nbsp;
Then I&rsquo;ve a lesson every day from Mademoiselle&mdash;the
elder daughter of the lady of the house and the intellectual one;
she has a wonderful fearless mind, <a name="page448"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 448</span>almost like my friend at the
hotel&mdash;and French give-and-take every evening in the salon,
from eight to eleven, with Madame herself and some friends of
hers who often come in.&nbsp; Her cousin, Mr. Verdier, a young
French gentleman, is fortunately staying with her, and I make a
point of talking with him as much as possible.&nbsp; I have
<i>extra-private lessons</i> from him, and I often ramble round
with him.&nbsp; Some night soon he&rsquo;s to accompany me to the
comic opera.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve also a most interesting plan of
visiting the galleries successively together and taking the
schools in their order&mdash;for they mean by &ldquo;the
schools&rdquo; here something quite different from what we
do.&nbsp; Like most of the French Mr. Verdier converses with
great fluency, and I feel I may really gain from him.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s remarkably handsome, in the French style, and
extremely polite&mdash;making a great many speeches which
I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t always do to pin one&rsquo;s
faith on.&nbsp; When I get down in Maine again I guess I&rsquo;ll
tell you some of the things he has said to me.&nbsp; I think
you&rsquo;ll consider them extremely curious&mdash;very beautiful
<i>in their French way</i>.</p>
<p>The conversation in the parlour (from eight to eleven) ranges
over many subjects&mdash;I sometimes feel as if it really avoided
<i>none</i>; and I often wish you or some of the Bangor folks
could be there to enjoy it.&nbsp; Even though you couldn&rsquo;t
understand it I think you&rsquo;d like to hear the way they go
on; they seem to express so much.&nbsp; I sometimes think that at
Bangor they don&rsquo;t express enough&mdash;except that it seems
as if over there they&rsquo;ve less <i>to</i> express.&nbsp; It
seems as if at Bangor there were things that folks never
<i>tried</i> to say; but I seem to have learned here from
studying French that you&rsquo;ve no idea what you <i>can</i> say
before you try.&nbsp; At Bangor they kind of give it up
beforehand; they don&rsquo;t make any effort.&nbsp; (I
don&rsquo;t say this in the least for William Platt <i>in
particular</i>.)</p>
<p><a name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
449</span>I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll
think of me when I get back anyway.&nbsp; It seems as if over
here I had learned to come out with everything.&nbsp; I suppose
they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m not sincere; but isn&rsquo;t it
more sincere to come right out with things than just to keep
feeling of them in your mind&mdash;without giving any one the
benefit?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve become very good friends with every one
in the house&mdash;that is (you see I <i>am</i> sincere) with
<i>almost</i> every one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the most interesting
circle I ever was in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a girl here, an
American, that I don&rsquo;t like so much as the rest; but
that&rsquo;s only because she won&rsquo;t let me.&nbsp; I should
like to like her, ever so much, because she&rsquo;s most lovely
and most attractive; but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to know
me or to take to me.&nbsp; She comes from New York and
she&rsquo;s remarkably pretty, with beautiful eyes and the most
delicate features; she&rsquo;s also splendidly stylish&mdash;in
this respect would bear comparison with any one I&rsquo;ve seen
over here.&nbsp; But it seems as if she didn&rsquo;t want to
recognise me or associate with me, as if she wanted to make a
difference between us.&nbsp; It is like people they call
&ldquo;haughty&rdquo; in books.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen any
one like that before&mdash;any one that wanted to make a
difference; and at first I was right down interested, she seemed
to me so like a proud young lady in a novel.&nbsp; I kept saying
to myself all day &ldquo;haughty, haughty,&rdquo; and I wished
she&rsquo;d keep on so.&nbsp; But she did keep on&mdash;she kept
on too long; and then I began to feel it in a different way, to
feel as if it kind of wronged me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t think
what I&rsquo;ve done, and I can&rsquo;t think yet.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s as if she had got some idea about me or had heard some
one say something.&nbsp; If some girls should behave like that I
wouldn&rsquo;t make any account of it; but this one&rsquo;s so
refined, and looks as if she might be so fascinating if I once
got to know her, that I think about it a good deal.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m bound to find out what her reason is&mdash;for of
course <a name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
450</span>she has got some reason; I&rsquo;m right down curious
to know.</p>
<p>I went up to her to ask her the day before yesterday; I
thought that the best way.&nbsp; I told her I wanted to know her
better and would like to come and see her in her room&mdash;they
tell me she has got a lovely one&mdash;and that if she had heard
anything against me perhaps she&rsquo;d tell me when I
came.&nbsp; But she was more distant than ever and just turned it
off; said she had never heard me mentioned and that her room was
too small to receive visitors.&nbsp; I suppose she spoke the
truth, but I&rsquo;m sure she has some peculiar ground, all the
same.&nbsp; She has got some idea; which I&rsquo;ll die if I
don&rsquo;t find out soon&mdash;if I have to ask every one in the
house.&nbsp; I never <i>could</i> be happy under an appearance of
wrong.&nbsp; I wonder if she doesn&rsquo;t think me
refined&mdash;or if she had ever heard anything against
Bangor?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you remember when Clara Barnard went to visit in New
York, three years ago, how much attention she received?&nbsp; And
you know Clara <i>is</i> Bangor, to the soles of her shoes.&nbsp;
Ask William Platt&mdash;so long as he isn&rsquo;t native&mdash;if
he doesn&rsquo;t consider Clara Barnard refined.</p>
<p>Apropos, as they say here, of refinement, there&rsquo;s
another American in the house&mdash;a gentleman from
Boston&mdash;who&rsquo;s just crammed with it.&nbsp; His
name&rsquo;s Mr. Louis Leverett (such a beautiful name I think)
and he&rsquo;s about thirty years old.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s rather
small and he looks pretty sick; he suffers from some affection of
the liver.&nbsp; But his conversation leads you right
on&mdash;they <i>do</i> go so far over here: even our people seem
to strain ahead in Europe, and perhaps when I get back it may
strike you I&rsquo;ve learned to keep up with them.&nbsp; I
delight to listen to him anyhow&mdash;he has such beautiful
ideas.&nbsp; I feel as if these moments were hardly right, not
being in French; but fortunately he <a name="page451"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 451</span>uses a great many French
expressions.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in a different style from the
dazzle of Mr. Verdier&mdash;not so personal, but much more
earnest: he says the only earnestness left in the world now is
French.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s intensely fond of pictures and has given
me a great many ideas about them that I&rsquo;d never have gained
without him; I shouldn&rsquo;t have known how to go to work to
strike them.&nbsp; He thinks everything of pictures; he thinks we
don&rsquo;t make near enough of them.&nbsp; They seem to make a
good deal of them here, but I couldn&rsquo;t help telling him the
other day that in Bangor I really don&rsquo;t think we do.</p>
<p>If I had any money to spend I&rsquo;d buy some and take them
back to hang right up.&nbsp; Mr. Leverett says it would do them
good&mdash;not the pictures, but the Bangor folks (though
sometimes he seems to want to hang <i>them</i> up too).&nbsp; He
thinks everything of the French, anyhow, and says we don&rsquo;t
make nearly enough of them.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help telling
him the other day that they certainly make enough of
<i>themselves</i>.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s very interesting to hear
him go on about the French, and it&rsquo;s so much gain to me,
since it&rsquo;s about the same as what I came for.&nbsp; I talk
to him as much as I dare about Boston, but I do feel as if this
were right down wrong&mdash;a stolen pleasure.</p>
<p>I can get all the Boston culture I want when I go back, if I
carry out my plan, my heart&rsquo;s secret, of going there to
reside.&nbsp; I ought to direct all my efforts to European
culture now, so as to keep Boston to finish off.&nbsp; But it
seems as if I couldn&rsquo;t help taking a peep now and then in
advance&mdash;with a real Bostonian.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
when I may meet one again; but if there are many others like Mr.
Leverett there I shall be certain not to lack when I carry out my
dream.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s just as full of culture as he can
live.&nbsp; But it seems strange how many different sorts there
are.</p>
<p><a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 452</span>There
are two of the English who I suppose are very cultivated too; but
it doesn&rsquo;t seem as if I could enter into theirs so easily,
though I try all I can.&nbsp; I do love their way of speaking,
and sometimes I feel almost as if it would be right to give up
going for French and just try to get the hang of English as these
people have got it.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t come out in the things
they say so much, though these are often rather curious, but in
the sweet way they say them and in their kind of making so much,
such an easy lovely effect, of saying almost anything.&nbsp; It
seems as if they must try a good deal to sound like that; but
these English who are here don&rsquo;t seem to try at all, either
to speak or do anything else.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a young lady
and her brother, who belong, I believe, to some noble
family.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a good deal of intercourse with
them, because I&rsquo;ve felt more free to talk to them than to
the Americans&mdash;on account of the language.&nbsp; They often
don&rsquo;t understand mine, and then it&rsquo;s as if I had to
learn theirs to explain.</p>
<p>I never supposed when I left Bangor that I was coming to
Europe to improve in <i>our</i> old language&mdash;and yet I feel
I can.&nbsp; If I do get where I <i>may</i> in it I guess
you&rsquo;ll scarcely understand me when I get back, and I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll particularly see the point.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d be a good deal criticised if I spoke like that at
Bangor.&nbsp; However, I verily believe Bangor&rsquo;s the most
critical place on earth; I&rsquo;ve seen nothing like it over
here.&nbsp; Well, tell them I&rsquo;ll give them about all they
can do.&nbsp; But I was speaking about this English young lady
and her brother; I wish I could put them before you.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s lovely just to see; she seems so modest and
retiring.&nbsp; In spite of this, however, she dresses in a way
that attracts great attention, as I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing
when one day I went out to walk with her.&nbsp; She was ever so
much more looked at than what I&rsquo;d have thought she&rsquo;d
like; but she <a name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
453</span>didn&rsquo;t seem to care, till at last I
couldn&rsquo;t help calling attention to it.&nbsp; Mr. Leverett
thinks everything of it; he calls it the &ldquo;costume of the
future.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d call it rather the costume of the
past&mdash;you know the English have such an attachment to the
past.&nbsp; I said this the other day to Madame de
Maisonrouge&mdash;that Miss Vane dressed in the costume of the
past.&nbsp; De l&rsquo;an pass&eacute;, vous voulez dire? she
asked in her gay French way.&nbsp; (You can get William Platt to
translate this; he used to tell me he knows so much French.)</p>
<p>You know I told you, in writing some time ago, that I had
tried to get some insight into the position of woman in England,
and, being here with Miss Vane, it has seemed to me to be a good
opportunity to get a little more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked her a
great deal about it, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem able to tell me
much.&nbsp; The first time I asked her she said the position of a
lady depended on the rank of her father, her eldest brother, her
husband&mdash;all on somebody else; and they, as to their
position, on something quite else (than themselves) as
well.&nbsp; She told me her own position was very good because
her father was some relation&mdash;I forget what&mdash;to a
lord.&nbsp; She thinks everything of this; and that proves to me
their standing can&rsquo;t be <i>really</i> good, because if it
were it wouldn&rsquo;t be involved in that of your relations,
even your nearest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much about lords, and
it does try my patience&mdash;though she&rsquo;s just as sweet as
she can live&mdash;to hear her talk as if it were a matter of
course I should.</p>
<p>I feel as if it were right to ask her as often as I can if she
doesn&rsquo;t consider every one equal; but she always says she
doesn&rsquo;t, and she confesses that she doesn&rsquo;t think
<i>she&rsquo;s</i> equal to Lady Something-or-Other, who&rsquo;s
the wife of that relation of her father.&nbsp; I try and persuade
her all I can that she <i>is</i>; but it seems as if she
didn&rsquo;t want to be persuaded, and when I ask her if that
superior being is of the same <a name="page454"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 454</span>opinion&mdash;that Miss Vane
isn&rsquo;t her equal&mdash;she looks so soft and pretty with her
eyes and says &ldquo;How can she not be?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I tell
her that this is right down bad for the other person it seems as
if she wouldn&rsquo;t believe me, and the only answer
she&rsquo;ll make is that the other person&rsquo;s &ldquo;awfully
nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s nice at all;
if she were nice she wouldn&rsquo;t have such ideas as
that.&nbsp; I tell Miss Vane that at Bangor we think such ideas
vulgar, but then she looks as though she had never heard of
Bangor.&nbsp; I often want to shake her, though she <i>is</i> so
sweet.&nbsp; If she isn&rsquo;t angry with the people who make
her feel that way at least I&rsquo;m angry <i>for</i> her.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m angry with her brother too, for she&rsquo;s evidently
very much afraid of him, and this gives me some further insight
into the subject.&nbsp; She thinks everything of her brother; she
thinks it natural she should be afraid of him not only
physically&mdash;for that is natural, as he&rsquo;s enormously
tall and strong, and has very big fists&mdash;but morally and
intellectually.&nbsp; She seems unable, however, to take in any
argument, and she makes me realise what I&rsquo;ve often
heard&mdash;that if you&rsquo;re timid nothing will reason you
out of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane also, the brother, seems to have the same prejudices,
and when I tell him, as I often think it right to do, that his
sister&rsquo;s not his subordinate, even if she does think so,
but his equal, and perhaps in some respects his superior, and
that if my brother in Bangor were to treat me as he treats this
charming but abject creature, who has not spirit enough to see
the question in its true light, there would be an
indignation-meeting of the citizens to protest against such an
outrage to the sanctity of womanhood&mdash;when I tell him all
this, at breakfast or dinner, he only bursts out laughing so loud
that all the plates clatter on the table.</p>
<p>But at such a time as this there&rsquo;s always one person <a
name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 455</span>who seems
interested in what I say&mdash;a German gentleman, a professor,
who sits next to me at dinner and whom I must tell you more about
another time.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very learned, but wants to push
further and further all the time; he appreciates a great many of
my remarks, and after dinner, in the salon, he often comes to me
to ask me questions about them.&nbsp; I have to think a little
sometimes to know what I did say or what I do think.&nbsp; He
takes you right up where you left off, and he&rsquo;s most as
fond of discussing things as William Platt ever was.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s splendidly educated, in the German style, and he told
me the other day that he was an &ldquo;intellectual
broom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, if he is he sweeps clean; I told him
that.&nbsp; After he has been talking to me I feel as if I
hadn&rsquo;t got a speck of dust left in my mind anywhere.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a most delightful feeling.&nbsp; He says he&rsquo;s a
remorseless observer, and though I don&rsquo;t know about
remorse&mdash;for a bright mind isn&rsquo;t a crime, is
it?&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty over here to
observe.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve told you enough for to-day.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how much longer I shall stay here; I&rsquo;m
getting on now so fast that it has come to seem sometimes as if I
shouldn&rsquo;t need all the time I&rsquo;ve laid out.&nbsp; I
suppose your cold weather has promptly begun, as usual; it
sometimes makes me envy you.&nbsp; The fall weather here is very
dull and damp, and I often suffer from the want of bracing.</p>

456</span>VI<br />
FROM MISS EVELYN VANE IN PARIS TO THE LADY AUGUSTA FLEMING AT
BRIGHTON</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>,
<i>September</i> 30.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady Augusta</span>,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I shall not be able to come to you on January
7th, as you kindly proposed at Homburg.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so very
very sorry; it&rsquo;s an immense disappointment.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ve just heard that it has been settled that mamma and the
children come abroad for a part of the winter, and mamma wishes
me to go with them to Hy&egrave;res, where Georgina has been
ordered for her lungs.&nbsp; She has not been at all well these
three months, and now that the damp weather has begun she&rsquo;s
very poorly indeed; so that last week papa decided to have a
consultation, and he and mamma went with her up to town and saw
some three or four doctors.&nbsp; They all of them ordered the
south of France, but they didn&rsquo;t agree about the place; so
that mamma herself decided for Hy&egrave;res, because it&rsquo;s
the most economical.&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s very dull, but I
hope it will do Georgina good.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid, however,
that nothing will do her good until she consents to take more
care of herself; I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s very wild and
wilful, and mamma tells me that all this month it has taken
papa&rsquo;s positive orders to make her stop indoors.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s very cross (mamma writes me) about coming abroad, and
<a name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
457</span>doesn&rsquo;t seem at all to mind the expense papa has
been put to&mdash;talks very ill-naturedly about her loss of the
hunting and even perhaps of the early spring meetings.&nbsp; She
expected to begin to hunt in December and wants to know whether
anybody keeps hounds at Hy&egrave;res.&nbsp; Fancy that rot when
she&rsquo;s too ill to sit a horse or to go anywhere.&nbsp; But I
daresay that when she gets there she&rsquo;ll be glad enough to
keep quiet, as they say the heat&rsquo;s intense.&nbsp; It may
cure Georgina, but I&rsquo;m sure it will make the rest of us
very ill.</p>
<p>Mamma, however, is only going to bring Mary and Gus and Fred
and Adelaide abroad with her: the others will remain at Kingscote
till February (about the 3rd) when they&rsquo;ll go to Eastbourne
for a month with Miss Turnover, the new governess, who has proved
such a very nice person.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going to take Miss
Travers, who has been with us so long, but is only qualified for
the younger children, to Hy&egrave;res, and I believe some of the
Kingscote servants.&nbsp; She has perfect confidence in Miss T.;
it&rsquo;s only a pity the poor woman has such an odd name.&nbsp;
Mamma thought of asking her if she would mind taking another when
she came; but papa thought she might object.&nbsp; Lady
Battledown makes all her governesses take the same name; she
gives &pound;5 more a year for the purpose.&nbsp; I forget what
it is she calls them; I think it&rsquo;s Johnson (which to me
always suggests a lady&rsquo;s maid).&nbsp; Governesses
shouldn&rsquo;t have too pretty a name&mdash;they shouldn&rsquo;t
have a nicer name than the family.</p>
<p>I suppose you heard from the Desmonds that I didn&rsquo;t go
back to England with them.&nbsp; When it began to be talked about
that Georgina should be taken abroad mamma wrote to me that I had
better stop in Paris for a month with Harold, so that she could
pick me up on their way to Hy&egrave;res.&nbsp; It saves the
expense of my journey to Kingscote and back, <a
name="page458"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 458</span>and gives
me the opportunity to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; a little in
French.</p>
<p>You know Harold came here six weeks ago to get up his French
for those dreadful exams that he has to pass so soon.&nbsp; He
came to live with some French people that take in young men (and
others) for this purpose; it&rsquo;s a kind of coaching-place,
only kept by women.&nbsp; Mamma had heard it was very nice, so
she wrote to me that I was to come and stop here with
Harold.&nbsp; The Desmonds brought me and made the arrangement or
the bargain or whatever you call it.&nbsp; Poor Harold was
naturally not at all pleased, but he has been very kind and has
treated me like an angel.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s getting on beautifully
with his French, for though I don&rsquo;t think the place is so
good as papa supposed, yet Harold is so immensely clever that he
can scarcely help learning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I learn much
less, but fortunately I haven&rsquo;t to go up for
anything&mdash;unless perhaps to mamma if she takes it into her
head to examine me.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;ll have so much to think
of with Georgina that I hope this won&rsquo;t occur to her.&nbsp;
If it does I shall be, as Harold says, in a dreadful funk.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t such a nice place for a girl as for a
gentleman, and the Desmonds thought it <i>exceedingly odd</i>
that mamma should wish me to come here.&nbsp; As Mrs. Desmond
said, it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s so very
unconventional.&nbsp; But you know Paris is so very amusing, and
if only Harold remains good-natured about it I shall be content
to wait for the caravan&mdash;which is what he calls mamma and
the children.&nbsp; The person who keeps the establishment, or
whatever they call it, is rather odd and <i>exceedingly
foreign</i>; but she&rsquo;s wonderfully civil and is perpetually
sending to my door to see if I want anything.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
tremendously pretentious and of course isn&rsquo;t a lady.&nbsp;
The servants are not at all like English ones and come <a
name="page459"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 459</span>bursting
in, the footman&mdash;they&rsquo;ve only one&mdash;and the maids
alike, at all sorts of hours, in the <i>most sudden
way</i>.&nbsp; Then when one rings it takes ages.&nbsp; Some of
the food too is rather nasty.&nbsp; All of which is very
uncomfortable, and I daresay will be worse at
Hy&egrave;res.&nbsp; There, however, fortunately, we shall have
our own people.</p>
<p>There are some very odd Americans here who keep throwing
Harold into fits of laughter.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s a dreadful little
man whom indeed he also wants to kick and who&rsquo;s always
sitting over the fire and talking about the colour of the
sky.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe he ever saw the sky except
through the window-pane.&nbsp; The other day he took hold of my
frock&mdash;that green one you thought so nice at
Homburg&mdash;and told me that it reminded him of the texture of
the Devonshire turf.&nbsp; And then he talked for half an hour
about the Devonshire turf, which I thought such a very
extraordinary subject.&nbsp; Harold firmly believes him
mad.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather horrid to be living in this way with
people one doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;I mean doesn&rsquo;t know as
one knows them in England.</p>
<p>The other Americans, beside the madman, are two girls about my
own age, one of whom is rather nice.&nbsp; She has a mother; but
the mother always sits in her bedroom, which seems so very
odd.&nbsp; I should like mamma to ask them to Kingscote, but
I&rsquo;m afraid mamma wouldn&rsquo;t like the mother,
who&rsquo;s awfully vulgar.&nbsp; The other girl is awfully
vulgar herself&mdash;she&rsquo;s travelling about quite
alone.&nbsp; I think she&rsquo;s a middle-class
schoolmistress&mdash;sacked perhaps for some irregularity; but
the other girl (I mean the nicer one, with the objectionable
mother) tells me she&rsquo;s more respectable than she
seems.&nbsp; She has, however, the most extraordinary
opinions&mdash;wishes to do away with the aristocracy, thinks it
wrong that Arthur should have Kingscote when papa dies,
etc.&nbsp; <a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
460</span>I don&rsquo;t see what it signifies to her that poor
Arthur should come into the property, which will be so
delightful&mdash;except for papa dying.&nbsp; But Harold says
she&rsquo;s mad too.&nbsp; He chaffs her tremendously about her
radicalism, and he&rsquo;s so immensely clever that she
can&rsquo;t answer him, though she has a supply of the most
extraordinary big words.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a Frenchman, a nephew or cousin or

FROM L&Eacute;ON VERDIER IN PARIS TO PROSPER GOBAIN AT LILLE</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 28.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mon Gros Vieux</span>,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time since I&rsquo;ve given you of my news,
and I don&rsquo;t know what puts it into my head to-night to
recall myself to your affectionate memory.&nbsp; I suppose it is
that when we&rsquo;re happy the mind reverts instinctively to
those with whom formerly we shared our vicissitudes, and <i>je
t&rsquo;en ai trop dit dans le bon temps</i>, <i>cher vieux</i>,
and you always listened to me too imperturbably, with your pipe
in your mouth and your waistcoat unbuttoned, for me not to feel
that I can count on your sympathy to-day.&nbsp; <i>Nous en
sommes-nous flanqu&eacute;s</i>, <i>des confidences</i>?&mdash;in
those happy days when my first thought in seeing an adventure
<i>poindre &agrave; l&rsquo;horizon</i> was of the pleasure I
should have in relating it to the great Prosper.&nbsp; As I tell
thee, I&rsquo;m happy; decidedly <i>j&rsquo;ai de la chance</i>,
and from that avowal I trust thee to construct the rest.&nbsp;
Shall I help thee a little?&nbsp; Take three adorable
girls&mdash;three, my good Prosper, the mystic number, neither
more nor less.&nbsp; Take them and place in the midst of them thy
insatiable little L&eacute;on.&nbsp; Is the situation
sufficiently indicated, or does the scene take more doing?</p>
<p>You expected perhaps I was going to tell thee I had made my
fortune, or that the Uncle Blondeau <a name="page462"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 462</span>had at last decided to recommit
himself to the breast of nature after having constituted me his
universal legatee.&nbsp; But I needn&rsquo;t remind you for how
much women have always been in any happiness of him who thus
overflows to you&mdash;for how much in any happiness and for how
much more in any misery.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let me talk of
misery now; time enough when it comes, when <i>ces
demoiselles</i> shall have joined the serried ranks of their
amiable predecessors.&nbsp; Ah, I comprehend your
impatience.&nbsp; I must tell you of whom <i>ces demoiselles</i>
consist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of my <i>cousine</i> de
Maisonrouge, that <i>grande belle femme</i> who, after having
married, <i>en secondes noces</i>&mdash;there had been, to tell
the truth, some irregularity about her first union&mdash;a
venerable relic of the old noblesse of Poitou, was left, by the
death of her husband, complicated by the crash of expensive
tastes against an income of 17,000 francs, on the pavement of
Paris with two little demons of daughters to bring up in the path
of virtue.&nbsp; She managed to bring them up; my little cousins
are ferociously <i>sages</i>.&nbsp; If you ask me how she managed
it I can&rsquo;t tell you; it&rsquo;s no business of mine, and
<i>a fortiori</i> none of yours.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s now fifty
years old&mdash;she confesses to thirty-eight&mdash;and her
daughters, whom she has never been able to place, are
respectively twenty-seven and twenty-three (they confess to
twenty and to seventeen).&nbsp; Three years ago she had the
thrice-blest idea of opening a well-upholstered and otherwise
attractive <i>asile</i> for the blundering barbarians who come to
Paris in the hope of picking up a few stray pearls from the
<i>&eacute;crin</i> of Voltaire&mdash;or of Zola.&nbsp; The idea
has brought her luck; the house does an excellent business.&nbsp;
Until within a few months ago it was carried on by my cousins
alone; but lately the need of a few extensions and improvements
has caused itself to be felt.&nbsp; My <a
name="page463"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 463</span>cousin has
undertaken them, regardless of expense; in other words she has
asked me to come and stay with her&mdash;board and lodging
gratis&mdash;and correct the conversational exercises of her
<i>pensionnaire</i>-pupils.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the extension, my
good Prosper; I&rsquo;m the improvement.&nbsp; She has enlarged
the <i>personnel</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;m the enlargement.&nbsp; I
form the exemplary sounds that the prettiest English lips are
invited to imitate.&nbsp; The English lips are not all pretty,
heaven knows, but enough of them are so to make it a good bargain
for me.</p>
<p>Just now, as I told you, I&rsquo;m in daily relation with
three separate pairs.&nbsp; The owner of one of them has private
lessons; she pays extra.&nbsp; My cousin doesn&rsquo;t give me a
sou of the money, but I consider nevertheless that I&rsquo;m not
a loser by the arrangement.&nbsp; Also I&rsquo;m well, very very
well, with the proprietors of the two other pairs.&nbsp; One of
these is a little Anglaise of twenty&mdash;a <i>figure de
keepsake</i>; the most adorable miss you ever, or at least I
ever, beheld.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s hung all over with beads and
bracelets and amulets, she&rsquo;s embroidered all over like a
sampler or a vestment; but her principal decoration consists of
the softest and almost the hugest grey eyes in the world, which
rest upon you with a profundity of confidence&mdash;a confidence
I really feel some compunction in betraying.&nbsp; She has a tint
as white as this sheet of paper, except just in the middle of
each cheek, where it passes into the purest and most transparent,
most liquid, carmine.&nbsp; Occasionally this rosy fluid
overflows into the rest of her face&mdash;by which I mean that
she blushes&mdash;as softly as the mark of your breath on the
window-pane.</p>
<p>Like every Anglaise she&rsquo;s rather pinched and prim in
public; but it&rsquo;s easy to see that when no one&rsquo;s
looking <i>elle ne demande qu&rsquo;&agrave; se laisser
aller</i>!&nbsp; Whenever she wants it I&rsquo;m always there,
and I&rsquo;ve given <a name="page464"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 464</span>her to understand she can count upon
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve reason to believe she appreciates the
assurance, though I&rsquo;m bound in honesty to confess that with
her the situation&rsquo;s a little less advanced than with the
others.&nbsp; <i>Que voulez-vous</i>?&nbsp; The English are heavy
and the Anglaises move slowly, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; The
movement, however, is perceptible, and once this fact&rsquo;s
established I can let the soup simmer, I can give her time to
arrive, for I&rsquo;m beautifully occupied with her
competitors.&nbsp; <i>They</i> don&rsquo;t keep me waiting,
please believe.</p>
<p>These young ladies are Americans, and it belongs to that
national character to move fast.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right&mdash;go
ahead!&rdquo;&nbsp; (I&rsquo;m learning a great deal of English,
or rather a great deal of American.)&nbsp; They go ahead at a
rate that sometimes makes it difficult for me to keep up.&nbsp;
One of them&rsquo;s prettier than the other; but this
latter&mdash;the one that takes the extra-private
lessons&mdash;is really <i>une fille &eacute;tonnante</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Ah par exemple</i>, <i>elle br&ucirc;le ses vaisseaux</i>,
<i>celle-l&agrave;</i>!&nbsp; She threw herself into my arms the
very first day, and I almost owed her a grudge for having
deprived me of that pleasure of gradation, of carrying the
defences one by one, which is almost as great as that of entering
the place.&nbsp; For would you believe that at the end of exactly
twelve minutes she gave me a rendezvous?&nbsp; In the Galerie
d&rsquo;Apollon at the Louvre I admit; but that was respectable
for a beginning, and since then we&rsquo;ve had them by the
dozen; I&rsquo;ve ceased to keep the account.&nbsp; <i>Non</i>,
<i>c&rsquo;est une fille qui me d&eacute;passe</i>.</p>
<p>The other, the slighter but &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; little
person&mdash;she has a mother somewhere out of sight, shut up in
a closet or a trunk&mdash;is a good deal prettier, and perhaps on
that account <i>elle y met plus de fa&ccedil;ons</i>.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t knock about Paris with me by the hour; she contents
herself with long interviews in the <i>petit salon</i>, with the
blinds half-drawn, beginning at about <a name="page465"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 465</span>three o&rsquo;clock, when every one
is <i>&agrave; la promenade</i>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s admirable,
<i>cette petite</i>, a little too immaterial, with the bones
rather over-accentuated, yet of a detail, on the whole, most
satisfactory.&nbsp; And you can say anything to her.&nbsp; She
takes the trouble to appear not to understand, but her conduct,
half an hour afterwards, reassures you completely&mdash;oh
completely!</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s the big bouncer of the extra-private
lessons who&rsquo;s the most remarkable.&nbsp; These private
lessons, my good Prosper, are the most brilliant invention of the
age, and a real stroke of genius on the part of Miss
Miranda!&nbsp; They also take place in the <i>petit salon</i>,
but with the doors tightly closed and with explicit directions to
every one in the house that we are not to be disturbed.&nbsp; And
we&rsquo;re not, <i>mon gros</i>, we&rsquo;re not!&nbsp; Not a
sound, not a shadow, interrupts our felicity.&nbsp; My cousins
are on the right track&mdash;such a house must make its
fortune.&nbsp; Miss Miranda&rsquo;s too tall and too flat, with a
certain want of coloration; she hasn&rsquo;t the transparent
<i>rougeurs</i> of the little Anglaise.&nbsp; But she has
wonderful far-gazing eyes, superb teeth, a nose modelled by a
sculptor, and a way of holding up her head and looking every one
in the face, which combines apparent innocence with complete
assurance in a way I&rsquo;ve never seen equalled.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s making the <i>tour du monde</i>, entirely alone,
without even a soubrette to carry the ensign, for the purpose of
seeing for herself, seeing <i>&agrave; quoi s&rsquo;en tenir sur
les hommes et les choses</i>&mdash;on <i>les hommes</i>
particularly.&nbsp; <i>Dis donc</i>, <i>mon vieux</i>, it must be
a <i>dr&ocirc;le de pays</i> over there, where such a view of the
right thing for the aspiring young bourgeoises is taken.&nbsp; If
we should turn the tables some day, thou and I, and go over and
see it for ourselves?&nbsp; Why isn&rsquo;t it as well we should
go and find them <i>chez elles</i>, as that they should come out
here after us?&nbsp; <i>Dis donc</i>, <i>mon gros Prosper</i> . .

466</span>VIII<br />
FROM DR. RUDOLPH STAUB IN PARIS TO DR. JULIUS HIRSCH AT
G&Ouml;TTINGEN</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother in Science</span>,</p>
<p>I resume my hasty notes, of which I sent you the first
instalment some weeks ago.&nbsp; I mentioned that I intended to
leave my hotel, not finding in it real matter.&nbsp; It was kept
by a Pomeranian and the waiters without exception were from the
Fatherland.&nbsp; I might as well have sat down with my note-book
Unter den Linden, and I felt that, having come here for
documentation, or to put my finger straight upon the social
pulse, I should project myself as much as possible into the
circumstances which are in part the consequence and in part the
cause of its activities and intermittences.&nbsp; I saw there
could be no well-grounded knowledge without this preliminary
operation of my getting a near view, as slightly as possible
modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of
forces, of the spontaneous home-life of the nation.</p>
<p>I accordingly engaged a room in the house of a lady of pure
French extraction and education, who supplements the shortcomings
of an income insufficient to the ever-growing demands of the
Parisian system of sense-gratification by providing food and
lodging for a limited number of distinguished strangers.&nbsp; <a
name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 467</span>I should
have preferred to have my room here only, and to take my meals in
a brewery, of very good appearance, which I speedily discovered
in the same street; but this arrangement, though very clearly set
out by myself, was not acceptable to the mistress of the
establishment&mdash;a woman with a mathematical head&mdash;and I
have consoled myself for the extra expense by fixing my thoughts
upon the great chance that conformity to the customs of the house
gives me of studying the table-manners of my companions, and of
observing the French nature at a peculiarly physiological moment,
the moment when the satisfaction of the <i>taste</i>, which is
the governing quality in its composition, produces a kind of
exhalation, an intellectual transpiration, which, though light
and perhaps invisible to a superficial spectator, is nevertheless
appreciable by a properly adjusted instrument.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
adjusted my instrument very satisfactorily&mdash;I mean the one I
carry in my good square German head&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not
afraid of losing a single drop of this valuable fluid as it
condenses itself upon the plate of my observation.&nbsp; A
prepared surface is what I need, and I&rsquo;ve prepared my
surface.</p>
<p>Unfortunately here also I find the individual native in the
minority.&nbsp; There are only four French persons in the
house&mdash;the individuals concerned in its management, three of
whom are women, and one a man.&nbsp; Such a preponderance of the
Weibliche is, however, in itself characteristic, as I
needn&rsquo;t remind you what an abnormally-developed part this
sex has played in French history.&nbsp; The remaining figure is
ostensibly that of a biped, and apparently that of a man, but I
hesitate to allow him the whole benefit of the higher
classification.&nbsp; He strikes me as less human than simian,
and whenever I hear him talk I seem to myself to have paused in
the street to listen to the shrill clatter of a hand-organ, to
which the <a name="page468"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
468</span>gambols of a hairy <i>homunculus</i> form an
accompaniment.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you before that my expectation of rough usage
in consequence of my unattenuated, even if not frivolously
aggressive, Teutonism was to prove completely unfounded.&nbsp; No
one seems either unduly conscious or affectedly unperceiving of
my so rich Berlin background; I&rsquo;m treated on the contrary
with the positive civility which is the portion of every
traveller who pays the bill without scanning the items too
narrowly.&nbsp; This, I confess, has been something of a surprise
to me, and I&rsquo;ve not yet made up my mind as to the
fundamental cause of the anomaly.&nbsp; My determination to take
up my abode in a French interior was largely dictated by the
supposition that I should be substantially disagreeable to its
inmates.&nbsp; I wished to catch in the fact the different forms
taken by the irritation I should naturally produce; for it is
under the influence of irritation that the French character most
completely expresses itself.&nbsp; My presence, however,
operates, as I say, less than could have been hoped as a
stimulus, and in this respect I&rsquo;m materially
disappointed.&nbsp; They treat me as they treat every one else;
whereas, in order to be treated differently, I was resigned in
advance to being treated worse.&nbsp; A further proof, if any
were needed, of that vast and, as it were, fluid <i>waste</i> (I
have so often dwelt on to you) which attends the process of
philosophic secretion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not, I repeat, fully
explained to myself this logical contradiction; but this is the
explanation to which I tend.&nbsp; The French are so exclusively
occupied with the idea of themselves that in spite of the very
definite image the German personality presented to them by the
war of 1870 they have at present no distinct apprehension of its
existence.&nbsp; They are not very sure that there <i>are</i>,
concretely, any Germans; they have already forgotten the <a
name="page469"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 469</span>convincing
proofs presented to them nine years ago.&nbsp; A German was
something disagreeable and disconcerting, an irreducible mass,
which they determined to keep out of their conception of
things.&nbsp; I therefore hold we&rsquo;re wrong to govern
ourselves upon the hypothesis of the <i>revanche</i>; the French
nature is too shallow for that large and powerful plant to bloom
in it.</p>
<p>The English-speaking specimens, too, I&rsquo;ve not been
willing to neglect the opportunity to examine; and among these
I&rsquo;ve paid special attention to the American varieties, of
which I find here several singular examples.&nbsp; The two most
remarkable are a young man who presents all the characteristics
of a period of national decadence; reminding me strongly of some
diminutive Hellenised Roman of the third century.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s an illustration of the period of culture in which the
faculty of appreciation has obtained such a preponderance over
that of production that the latter sinks into a kind of rank
sterility, and the mental condition becomes analogous to that of
a malarious bog.&nbsp; I hear from him of the existence of an
immense number of Americans exactly resembling him, and that the
city of Boston indeed is almost exclusively composed of
them.&nbsp; (He communicated this fact very proudly, as if it
were greatly to the credit of his native country; little
perceiving the truly sinister impression it made on me.)</p>
<p>What strikes one in it is that it is a phenomenon to the best
of my knowledge&mdash;and you know what my knowledge
is&mdash;unprecedented and unique in the history of mankind; the
arrival of a nation at an ultimate stage of evolution without
having passed through the mediate one; the passage of the fruit,
in other words, from crudity to rottenness, without the
interposition of a period of useful (and ornamental)
ripeness.&nbsp; With the Americans indeed the crudity and the <a
name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 470</span>rottenness
are identical and simultaneous; it is impossible to say, as in
the conversation of this deplorable young man, which is the one
and which the other: they&rsquo;re inextricably confused.&nbsp;
Homunculus for homunculus I prefer that of the Frenchman;
he&rsquo;s at least more amusing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting in this manner to perceive, so largely
developed, the germs of extinction in the so-called powerful
Anglo-Saxon family.&nbsp; I find them in almost as recognisable a
form in a young woman from the State of Maine, in the province of
New England, with whom I have had a good deal of
conversation.&nbsp; She differs somewhat from the young man I
just mentioned in that the state of affirmation, faculty of
production and capacity for action are things, in her, less
inanimate; she has more of the freshness and vigour that we
suppose to belong to a young civilisation.&nbsp; But
unfortunately she produces nothing but evil, and her tastes and
habits are similarly those of a Roman lady of the lower
Empire.&nbsp; She makes no secret of them and has in fact worked
out a complete scheme of experimental adventure, that is of
personal licence, which she is now engaged in carrying out.&nbsp;
As the opportunities she finds in her own country fail to satisfy
her she has come to Europe &ldquo;to try,&rdquo; as she says,
&ldquo;for herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the doctrine of
universal &ldquo;unprejudiced&rdquo; experience professed with a
cynicism that is really most extraordinary, and which, presenting
itself in a young woman of considerable education, appears to me
to be the judgement of a society.</p>
<p>Another observation which pushes me to the same
induction&mdash;that of the premature vitiation of the American
population&mdash;is the attitude of the Americans whom I have
before me with regard to each other.&nbsp; I have before me a
second flower of the same huge so-called democratic garden, who
is less abnormally developed than the one I have just described,
<a name="page471"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 471</span>but who
yet bears the stamp of this peculiar combination of the barbarous
and, to apply to them one of their own favourite terms, the
<i>ausgespielt</i>, the &ldquo;played-out.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
three little persons look with the greatest mistrust and aversion
upon each other; and each has repeatedly taken me apart and
assured me secretly, that he or she only is the real, the
genuine, the typical American.&nbsp; A type that has lost itself
before it has been fixed&mdash;what can you look for from
this?</p>
<p>Add to this that there are two young Englanders in the house
who hate all the Americans in a lump, making between them none of
the distinctions and favourable comparisons which they insist
upon, and for which, as involving the recognition of shades and a
certain play of the critical sense, the still quite primitive
insular understanding is wholly inapt, and you will, I think,
hold me warranted in believing that, between precipitate decay
and internecine enmities, the English-speaking family is destined
to consume itself, and that with its decline the prospect of
successfully-organised conquest and unarrested incalculable
expansion, to which I alluded above, will brighten for the
deep-lunged children of the Fatherland!</p>

MIRANDA HOPE TO HER MOTHER</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 22.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m off in a day or two to visit some new country; I
haven&rsquo;t yet decided which.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve satisfied
myself with regard to France, and obtained a good knowledge of
the language.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my visit to Madame de
Maisonrouge deeply, and feel as if I were leaving a circle of
real friends.&nbsp; Everything has gone on beautifully up to the
end, and every one has been as kind and attentive as if I were
their own sister, especially Mr. Verdier, the French gentleman,
from whom I have gained more than I ever expected (in six weeks)
and with whom I have promised to <i>correspond</i>.&nbsp; So you
can imagine me dashing off the liveliest and yet the most elegant
French letters; and if you don&rsquo;t believe in them I&rsquo;ll
keep the rough drafts to show you when I go back.</p>
<p>The German gentleman is also more interesting the more you
know him; it seems sometimes as if I could fairly drink in his
ideas.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found out why the young lady from New
York doesn&rsquo;t like me!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because I said one
day at dinner that I <i>admired</i> to go to the Louvre.&nbsp;
Well, when I first came it seemed as if I <i>did</i> admire
everything!&nbsp; Tell William Platt his letter has come.&nbsp; I
knew he&rsquo;d have to write, <a name="page473"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>and I was bound I&rsquo;d make
him!&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t decided what country I&rsquo;ll visit
next; it seems as if there were so many to choose from.&nbsp; But
I must take care to pick out a good one and to meet plenty of
fresh experiences.&nbsp; Dearest mother, my money holds out, and
it is most interesting!</p>

FROM MISS AURORA CHURCH AT SEA TO MISS WHITESIDE IN PARIS</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 1880.</p>
<p>. . .&nbsp; My dear child, the bromide of sodium (if
that&rsquo;s what you call it) proved perfectly useless.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean that it did me no good, but that I never had
occasion to take the bottle out of my bag.&nbsp; It might have
done wonders for me if I had needed it; but I didn&rsquo;t,
simply because I&rsquo;ve been a wonder myself.&nbsp; Will you
believe that I&rsquo;ve spent the whole voyage on deck, in the
most animated conversation and exercise?&nbsp; Twelve times round
the deck make a mile, I believe; and by this measurement
I&rsquo;ve been walking twenty miles a day.&nbsp; And down to
every meal, if you please, where I&rsquo;ve displayed the
appetite of a fishwife.&nbsp; Of course the weather has been
lovely; so there&rsquo;s no great merit.&nbsp; The wicked old
Atlantic has been as blue as the sapphire in my only
ring&mdash;rather a good one&mdash;and as smooth as the slippery
floor of Madame Galopin&rsquo;s dining-room.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
been for the last three hours in sight of land, and are soon to
enter the Bay of New York which is said to be exquisitely
beautiful.&nbsp; But of course you recall it, though they say
everything changes so fast over here.&nbsp; I find I don&rsquo;t
remember anything, for my recollections of our voyage to Europe
so many years ago are <a name="page478"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 478</span>exceedingly dim; I&rsquo;ve only a
painful impression that mamma shut me up for an hour every day in
the stateroom and made me learn by heart some religious
poem.&nbsp; I was only five years old and I believe that as a
child I was extremely timid; on the other hand mamma, as you
know, had what she called a method with me.&nbsp; She has it to
this day; only I&rsquo;ve become indifferent; I&rsquo;ve been so
pinched and pushed&mdash;morally speaking, <i>bien
entendu</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, however, that there are
children of five on the vessel to-day who have been extremely
conspicuous&mdash;ranging all over the ship and always under
one&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Of course they&rsquo;re little
compatriots, which means that they&rsquo;re little
barbarians.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to pronounce <i>all</i> our
compatriots barbarous; they seem to improve somehow after their
first communion.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s that
ceremony that improves them, especially as so few of them go in
for it; but the women are certainly nicer than the little girls;
I mean of course in proportion, you know.&nbsp; You warned me not
to generalise, and you see I&rsquo;ve already begun, before
we&rsquo;ve arrived.&nbsp; But I suppose there&rsquo;s no harm in
it so long as it&rsquo;s favourable.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it favourable when I say I&rsquo;ve had the most
lovely time?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had so much liberty in my
life, and I&rsquo;ve been out alone, as you may say, every day of
the voyage.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s a foretaste of what&rsquo;s to
come I shall take very kindly to that.&nbsp; When I say
I&rsquo;ve been out alone I mean we&rsquo;ve always been
two.&nbsp; But we two were alone, so to speak, and it
wasn&rsquo;t like always having mamma or Madame Galopin, or some
lady in the pension or the temporary cook.&nbsp; Mamma has been
very poorly; she&rsquo;s so very well on land that it&rsquo;s a
wonder to see her at all taken down.&nbsp; She says, however,
that it isn&rsquo;t the being at sea; it&rsquo;s on the contrary
approaching the land.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not in a hurry to arrive;
she keeps well before her that great disillusions <a
name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 479</span>await
us.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know she <i>had</i> any
illusions&mdash;she has too many opinions, I should think, for
that: she discriminates, as she&rsquo;s always saying, from
morning till night.&nbsp; Where would the poor illusions find
room?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s meanwhile very serious; she sits for
hours in perfect silence, her eyes fixed on the horizon.&nbsp; I
heard her say yesterday to an English gentleman&mdash;a very odd
Mr. Antrobus, the only person with whom she converses&mdash;that
she was afraid she shouldn&rsquo;t like her native land, and that
she shouldn&rsquo;t like not liking it.&nbsp; But this is a
mistake; she&rsquo;ll like that immensely&mdash;I mean the not
liking it.&nbsp; If it should prove at all agreeable she&rsquo;ll
be furious, for that will go against her system.&nbsp; You know
all about mamma&rsquo;s system; I&rsquo;ve explained it so
often.&nbsp; It goes against her system that we should come back
at all; that was <i>my</i> system&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had at last to
invent one!&nbsp; She consented to come only because she saw
that, having no <i>dot</i>, I should never marry in Europe; and I
pretended to be immensely preoccupied with this idea in order to
make her start.&nbsp; In reality <i>cela m&rsquo;est parfaitement
&eacute;gal</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only afraid I shall like it too
much&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean marriage, of course, but the sense
of a native land.&nbsp; Say what you will, it&rsquo;s a charming
thing to go out alone, and I&rsquo;ve given notice that I mean to
be always <i>en course</i>.&nbsp; When I tell mamma this she
looks at me in the same silence; her eyes dilate and then she
slowly closes them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if the sea were affecting
her a little, though it&rsquo;s so beautifully calm.&nbsp; I ask
her if she&rsquo;ll try my bromide, which is there in my bag; but
she motions me off and I begin to walk again, tapping my little
boot-soles on the smooth clean deck.&nbsp; This allusion to my
boot-soles, by the way, isn&rsquo;t prompted by vanity; but
it&rsquo;s a fact that at sea one&rsquo;s feet and one&rsquo;s
shoes assume the most extraordinary importance, so that one
should take the precaution to have nice ones.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
all you seem to see as the people <a name="page480"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 480</span>walk about the deck; you get to know
them intimately and to dislike some of them so much.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll think that I&rsquo;ve already
broken loose; and for aught I know I&rsquo;m writing as a
demoiselle bien-&eacute;l&eacute;vee shouldn&rsquo;t write.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the American air; if it is,
all I can say is that the American air&rsquo;s very
charming.&nbsp; It makes me impatient and restless, and I sit
scribbling here because I&rsquo;m so eager to arrive and the time
passes better if I occupy myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the saloon, where we have our meals, and opposite
me is a big round porthole, wide open to let in the smell of the
land.&nbsp; Every now and then I rise a little and look through
it to see if we&rsquo;re arriving.&nbsp; I mean in the Bay, you
know, for we shall not come up to the city till dark.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to lose the Bay; it appears it&rsquo;s so
wonderful.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t exactly understand what it
contains except some beautiful islands; but I suppose
you&rsquo;ll know all about that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy to see
that these are the last hours, for all the people about me are
writing letters to put into the post as soon as we come up to the
dock.&nbsp; I believe they&rsquo;re dreadful at the custom-house,
and you&rsquo;ll remember how many new things you persuaded mamma
that&mdash;with my preoccupation of marriage&mdash;I should take
to this country, where even the prettiest girls are expected not
to go unadorned.&nbsp; We ruined ourselves in
Paris&mdash;that&rsquo;s partly accountable for mamma&rsquo;s
solemnity&mdash;<i>mais au moins je serai belle</i>!&nbsp;
Moreover I believe that mamma&rsquo;s prepared to say or to do
anything that may be necessary for escaping from their odious
duties; as she very justly remarks she can&rsquo;t afford to be
ruined twice.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how one approaches these
terrible <i>douaniers</i>, but I mean to invent something very
charming.&nbsp; I mean to say &ldquo;Voyons, Messieurs, a young
girl like me, brought up in the strictest foreign traditions,
kept always in the background by a very superior
mother&mdash;<i>la voil&agrave;</i>; <a name="page481"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 481</span>you can see for yourself!&mdash;what
is it possible that she should attempt to smuggle in?&nbsp;
Nothing but a few simple relics of her convent!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t tell them my convent was called the Magasin du Bon
March&eacute;.&nbsp; Mamma began to scold me three days ago for
insisting on so many trunks, and the truth is that between us
we&rsquo;ve not fewer than seven.&nbsp; For relics, that&rsquo;s
a good many!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all writing very long
letters&mdash;or at least we&rsquo;re writing a great
number.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no news of the Bay as yet.&nbsp; Mr.
Antrobus, mamma&rsquo;s friend, opposite to me, is beginning on
his ninth.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a Right Honourable and a Member of
Parliament; he has written during the voyage about a hundred
letters and seems greatly alarmed at the number of stamps
he&rsquo;ll have to buy when he arrives.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s full of
information, but he hasn&rsquo;t enough, for he asks as many
questions as mamma when she goes to hire apartments.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s going to &ldquo;look into&rdquo; various things; he
speaks as if they had a little hole for the purpose.&nbsp; He
walks almost as much as I, and has enormous shoes.&nbsp; He asks
questions even of me, and I tell him again and again that I know
nothing about America.&nbsp; But it makes no difference; he
always begins again, and indeed it&rsquo;s not strange he should
find my ignorance incredible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now how would it be in
one of your South-western States?&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s his
favourite way of opening conversation.&nbsp; Fancy me giving an
account of one of &ldquo;my&rdquo; South-western States!&nbsp; I
tell him he had better ask mamma&mdash;a little to tease that
lady, who knows no more about such places than I.&nbsp; Mr.
Antrobus is very big and black; he speaks with a sort of brogue;
he has a wife and ten children; he doesn&rsquo;t say&mdash;apart
from his talking&mdash;anything at all to me.&nbsp; But he has
lots of letters to people <i>l&agrave;-bas</i>&mdash;I forget
that we&rsquo;re just arriving&mdash;and mamma, who takes an
interest in him in spite of his views (which are dreadfully
advanced, <a name="page482"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
482</span>and not at all like mamma&rsquo;s own) has promised to
give him the entr&eacute;e to the best society.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what she knows about the best society over here
to-day, for we&rsquo;ve not kept up our connexions at all, and no
one will know&mdash;or, I am afraid, care&mdash;anything about
us.&nbsp; She has an idea we shall be immensely recognised; but
really, except the poor little Rucks, who are bankrupt and,
I&rsquo;m told, in no society at all, I don&rsquo;t know on whom
we can count.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est &eacute;gal, mamma has an idea
that, whether or no we appreciate America ourselves, we shall at
least be universally appreciated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true we have
begun to be, a little; you would see that from the way Mr.
Cockerel and Mr. Louis Leverett are always inviting me to
walk.&nbsp; Both of these gentlemen, who are Americans, have
asked leave to call on me in New York, and I&rsquo;ve said <i>Mon
Dieu oui</i>, if it&rsquo;s the custom of the country.&nbsp; Of
course I&rsquo;ve not dared to tell this to mamma, who flatters
herself that we&rsquo;ve brought with us in our trunks a complete
set of customs of our own and that we shall only have to shake
them out a little and put them on when we arrive.&nbsp; If only
the two gentlemen I just spoke of don&rsquo;t call at the same
time I don&rsquo;t think I shall be too much frightened.&nbsp; If
they do, on the other hand, I won&rsquo;t answer for it.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve a particular aversion to each other and are ready
to fight about poor little me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only the pretext,
however; for, as Mr. Leverett says, it&rsquo;s really the
opposition of temperaments.&nbsp; I hope they won&rsquo;t cut
each other&rsquo;s throats, for I&rsquo;m not crazy about either
of them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very well for the deck of a ship,
but I shouldn&rsquo;t care about them in a salon; they&rsquo;re
not at all distinguished.&nbsp; They think they are, but
they&rsquo;re not; at least Mr. Louis Leverett does; Mr. Cockerel
doesn&rsquo;t appear to care so much.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
extremely different&mdash;with their opposed
temperaments&mdash;and each very amusing for a while; but I
should get <a name="page483"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
483</span>dreadfully tired of passing my life with either.&nbsp;
Neither has proposed that as yet; but it&rsquo;s evidently what
they&rsquo;re coming to.&nbsp; It will be in a great measure to
spite each other, for I think that au fond they don&rsquo;t quite
believe in me.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the only
point on which they agree.&nbsp; They hate each other awfully;
they take such different views.&nbsp; That is Mr. Cockerel hates
Mr. Leverett&mdash;he calls him a sickly little ass; he
pronounces his opinions half affectation and the other half
dyspepsia.&nbsp; Mr. Leverett speaks of Mr. Cockerel as a
&ldquo;strident savage,&rdquo; but he allows he finds him most
diverting.&nbsp; He says there&rsquo;s nothing in which we
can&rsquo;t find a certain entertainment if we only look at it in
the right way, and that we have no business with either hating or
loving: we ought only to strive to understand.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;claims&rdquo;&mdash;he&rsquo;s always claiming&mdash;that
to understand is to forgive.&nbsp; Which is very pretty, but I
don&rsquo;t like the suppression of our affections, though
I&rsquo;ve no desire to fix mine upon Mr. Leverett.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s very artistic and talks like an article in some
review.&nbsp; He has lived a great deal in Paris, and Mr.
Cockerel, who doesn&rsquo;t believe in Paris, says it&rsquo;s
what has made him such an idiot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not complimentary to you, dear Louisa, and still
less to your brilliant brother; for Mr. Cockerel explains that he
means it (the bad effect of Paris) chiefly of men.&nbsp; In fact
he means the bad effect of Europe altogether.&nbsp; This,
however, is compromising to mamma; and I&rsquo;m afraid
there&rsquo;s no doubt that, from what I&rsquo;ve told him, he
thinks mamma also an idiot.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;m not responsible, you
know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go home.)&nbsp; If mamma
knew him, which she doesn&rsquo;t, for she always closes her eyes
when I pass on his arm, she would think him disgusting.&nbsp; Mr.
Leverett meanwhile assures me he&rsquo;s nothing to what we shall
see yet.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s from <a name="page484"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 484</span>Philadelphia (Mr. Cockerel); he
insists that we shall go and see Philadelphia, but mamma says she
saw it in 1855 and it was then <i>affreux</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Cockerel
says that mamma&rsquo;s evidently not familiar with the rush of
improvement in this country; he speaks of 1855 as if it were a
hundred years ago.&nbsp; Mamma says she knows it goes only too
fast, the rush&mdash;it goes so fast that it has time to do
nothing well; and then Mr. Cockerel, who, to do him justice, is
perfectly good-natured, remarks that she had better wait till she
has been ashore and seen the improvements.&nbsp; Mamma retorts
that she sees them from here, the awful things, and that they
give her a sinking of the heart.&nbsp; (This little exchange of
ideas is carried on through me; they&rsquo;ve never spoken to
each other.)&nbsp; Mr. Cockerel, as I say, is extremely
good-natured, and he bears out what I&rsquo;ve heard said about
the men in America being very considerate of the women.&nbsp;
They evidently listen to them a great deal; they don&rsquo;t
contradict them, but it seems to me this is rather
negative.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s very little gallantry in not
contradicting one; and it strikes me that there are some things
the men don&rsquo;t express.&nbsp; There are others on the ship
whom I&rsquo;ve noticed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if they were all
one&rsquo;s brothers or one&rsquo;s cousins.&nbsp; The extent to
which one isn&rsquo;t in danger from them&mdash;my dear, my
dear!&nbsp; But I promised you not to generalise, and perhaps
there will be more expression when we arrive.&nbsp; Mr. Cockerel
returns to America, after a general tour, with a renewed
conviction that this is the only country.&nbsp; I left him on
deck an hour ago looking at the coast-line with an opera-glass
and saying it was the prettiest thing he had seen in all his
travels.&nbsp; When I remarked that the coast seemed rather low
he said it would be all the easier to get ashore.&nbsp; Mr.
Leverett at any rate doesn&rsquo;t seem in a hurry to get ashore,
he&rsquo;s sitting within sight of me in a corner of the
saloon&mdash;writing letters, I suppose, <a
name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 485</span>but
looking, from the way he bites his pen and rolls his eyes about,
as if he were composing a sonnet and waiting for a rhyme.&nbsp;
Perhaps the sonnet&rsquo;s addressed to me; but I forget that he
suppresses the affections!&nbsp; The only person in whom mamma
takes much interest is the great French critic, M. Lejaune, whom
we have the honour to carry with us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve read a few
of his works, though mamma disapproves of his tendencies and
thinks him a dreadful materialist.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve read them
for the style; you know he&rsquo;s one of the new
Academicians.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a Frenchman like any other, except
that he&rsquo;s rather more quiet; he has a grey moustache and
the ribbon of the Legion of Honour.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the first
French writer of distinction who has been to America since De
Tocqueville; the French, in such matters, are not very
enterprising.&nbsp; Also he has the air of wondering what
he&rsquo;s doing <i>dans cette gal&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; He has
come with his beau-fr&egrave;re, who&rsquo;s an engineer and is
looking after some mines, and he talks with scarcely any one
else, as he speaks no English and appears to take for granted
that no one speaks French.&nbsp; Mamma would be delighted to
convince him of the contrary; she has never conversed with an
Academician.&nbsp; She always makes a little vague inclination,
with a smile, when he passes her, and he answers with a most
respectful bow; but it goes no further, to mamma&rsquo;s
disappointment.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always with the
beau-fr&egrave;re, a rather untidy fat bearded
man&mdash;decorated too, always smoking and looking at the feet
of the ladies, whom mamma (though she has very good feet) has not
the courage to <i>aborder</i>.&nbsp; I believe M. Lejaune is
going to write a book about America, and Mr. Leverett says it
will be terrible.&nbsp; Mr. Leverett has made his acquaintance
and says M. Lejaune will put him into his book; he says the
movement of the French intellect is superb.&nbsp; As a general
thing he doesn&rsquo;t care for Academicians, <a
name="page486"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 486</span>but M.
Lejaune&rsquo;s an exception&mdash;he&rsquo;s so living, so
remorseless, so personal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked Mr. Cockerel meanwhile what he thinks of M.
Lejaune&rsquo;s plan of writing a book, and he answers that he
doesn&rsquo;t see what it matters to him that a Frenchman the
more should make the motions of a monkey&mdash;on that side poor
Mr. Cockerel is <i>de cette force</i>.&nbsp; I asked him why he
hadn&rsquo;t written a book about Europe, and he says that in the
first place Europe isn&rsquo;t worth writing about, and that in
the second if he said what he thought people would call it a
joke.&nbsp; He says they&rsquo;re very superstitious about Europe
over here; he wants people in America to behave as if Europe
didn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp; I told this to Mr. Leverett, and he
answered that if Europe didn&rsquo;t exist America
wouldn&rsquo;t, for Europe keeps us alive by buying our
corn.&nbsp; He said also that the trouble with America in the
future will be that she&rsquo;ll produce things in such enormous
quantities that there won&rsquo;t be enough people in the rest of
the world to buy them, and that we shall be left with our
productions&mdash;most of them very hideous&mdash;on our
hands.&nbsp; I asked him if he thought corn a hideous production,
and he replied that there&rsquo;s nothing more unbeautiful than
too much food.&nbsp; I think that to feed the world too well,
however, will be after all a <i>beau r&ocirc;le</i>.&nbsp; Of
course I don&rsquo;t understand these things, and I don&rsquo;t
believe Mr. Leverett does; but Mr. Cockerel seems to know what
he&rsquo;s talking about, and he describes America as complete in
herself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know exactly what he means, but he
speaks as if human affairs had somehow moved over to this side of
the world.&nbsp; It may be a very good place for them, and heaven
knows I&rsquo;m extremely tired of Europe, which mamma has always
insisted so on my appreciating; but I don&rsquo;t think I like
the idea of our being so completely cut off.&nbsp; Mr. Cockerel
says it is not we that are cut off, but Europe, <a
name="page487"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 487</span>and he
seems to think Europe has somehow deserved it.&nbsp; That may be;
our life over there was sometimes extremely tiresome, though
mamma says it&rsquo;s now that our real fatigues will
begin.&nbsp; I like to abuse those dreadful old countries myself,
but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m pleased when others do the
same.&nbsp; We had some rather pretty moments there after all,
and at Piacenza we certainly lived for four francs a day.&nbsp;
Mamma&rsquo;s already in a terrible state of mind about the
expenses here; she&rsquo;s frightened by what people on the ship
(the few she has spoken to) have told her.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
one comfort at any rate&mdash;we&rsquo;ve spent so much money in
coming that we shall have none left to get away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
scribbling along, as you see, to occupy me till we get news of
the islands.&nbsp; Here comes Mr. Cockerel to bring it.&nbsp;
Yes, they&rsquo;re in sight; he tells me they&rsquo;re lovelier
than ever and that I must come right up right away.&nbsp; I
suppose you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m already beginning to use the
language of the country.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certain that at the end
of the month I shall speak nothing else.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve picked
up every dialect, wherever we&rsquo;ve travelled; you&rsquo;ve
heard my Platt-Deutsch and my Neapolitan.&nbsp; But, <i>voyons un
peu</i> the Bay!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just called to Mr. Leverett to
remind him of the islands.&nbsp; &ldquo;The islands&mdash;the
islands?&nbsp; Ah my dear young lady, I&rsquo;ve seen Capri,
I&rsquo;ve seen Ischia!&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, so have I, but that
doesn&rsquo;t prevent . . .&nbsp; (<i>A little later</i>.)&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve seen the islands&mdash;they&rsquo;re rather queer.</p>
<h3><a name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
488</span>II<br />
MRS. CHURCH IN NEW YORK TO MADAME GALOPIN AT GENEVA</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 1880.</p>
<p>If I felt far way from you in the middle of that deplorable
Atlantic, ch&egrave;re Madame, how do I feel now, in the heart of
this extraordinary city?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
arrived&mdash;we&rsquo;ve arrived, dear friend; but I don&rsquo;t
know whether to tell you that I consider that an advantage.&nbsp;
If we had been given our choice of coming safely to land or going
down to the bottom of the sea I should doubtless have chosen the
former course; for I hold, with your noble husband and in
opposition to the general tendency of modern thought, that our
lives are not our own to dispose of, but a sacred trust from a
higher power by whom we shall be held responsible.&nbsp;
Nevertheless if I had foreseen more vividly some of the
impressions that awaited me here I&rsquo;m not sure that, for my
daughter at least, I shouldn&rsquo;t have preferred on the spot
to hand in our account.&nbsp; Should I not have been less (rather
than more) guilty in presuming to dispose of <i>her</i> destiny
than of my own?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a nice point for dear M.
Galopin to settle&mdash;one of those points I&rsquo;ve heard him
discuss in the pulpit with such elevation.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
safe, however, as I say; by which I mean we&rsquo;re physically
safe.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve taken up the thread of our familiar
pension-life, but under <a name="page489"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 489</span>strikingly different
conditions.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve found a refuge in a boarding-house
which has been highly recommended to me and where the
arrangements partake of the barbarous magnificence that in this
country is the only alternative from primitive rudeness.&nbsp;
The terms per week are as magnificent as all the rest.&nbsp; The
landlady wears diamond ear-rings and the drawing-rooms are
decorated with marble statues.&nbsp; I should indeed be sorry to
let you know how I&rsquo;ve allowed myself to be
ran&ccedil;onn&eacute;e; and I should be still more sorry that it
should come to the ears of any of my good friends in Geneva, who
know me less well than you and might judge me more harshly.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no wine given for dinner, and I&rsquo;ve vainly
requested the person who conducts the establishment to garnish
her table more liberally.&nbsp; She says I may have all the wine
I want if I will order it at the merchant&rsquo;s and settle the
matter with himself.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve never, as you know,
consented to regard our modest allowance of eau rougie as an
extra; indeed, I remember that it&rsquo;s largely to your
excellent advice that I&rsquo;ve owed my habit of being firm on
this point.</p>
<p>There are, however, greater difficulties than the question of
what we shall drink for dinner, ch&egrave;re Madame.&nbsp; Still,
I&rsquo;ve never lost courage and I shall not lose it now.&nbsp;
At the worst we can re-embark again and seek repose and
refreshment on the shores of your beautiful lake.&nbsp;
(There&rsquo;s absolutely no scenery here!)&nbsp; We shall not
perhaps in that case have achieved what we desired, but we shall
at least have made an honourable retreat.&nbsp; What we
desire&mdash;I know it&rsquo;s just this that puzzles you, dear
friend; I don&rsquo;t think you ever really comprehended my
motives in taking this formidable step, though you were good
enough, and your magnanimous husband was good enough, to press my
hand at parting in a way that seemed to tell me you&rsquo;d still
be with me even were I wrong.&nbsp; To be very <a
name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 490</span>brief, I
wished to put an end to the ceaseless reclamations of my
daughter.&nbsp; Many Americans had assured her that she was
wasting her belle jeunesse in those historic lands which it was
her privilege to see so intimately, and this unfortunate
conviction had taken possession of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me at
least see for myself,&rdquo; she used to say; &ldquo;if I should
dislike it over there as much as you promise me, so much the
better for you.&nbsp; In that case we&rsquo;ll come back and make
a new arrangement at Stuttgart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
experiment&rsquo;s a terribly expensive one, but you know how my
devotion never has shrunk from an ordeal.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
another point moreover which, from a mother to a mother, it would
be affectation not to touch upon.&nbsp; I remember the just
satisfaction with which you announced to me the
fian&ccedil;ailles of your charming C&eacute;cile.&nbsp; You know
with what earnest care my Aurora has been educated&mdash;how
thoroughly she&rsquo;s acquainted with the principal results of
modern research.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve always studied together,
we&rsquo;ve always enjoyed together.&nbsp; It will perhaps
surprise you to hear that she makes these very advantages a
reproach to me&mdash;represents them as an injury to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;the gentlemen have not those accomplishments; they care
nothing for the results of modern research.&nbsp; Therefore it
won&rsquo;t help a young person to be sought in marriage that she
can give an account of the latest German presentation of
Pessimism.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s possible, and I&rsquo;ve
never concealed from her that it wasn&rsquo;t for this country I
had educated her.&nbsp; If she marries in the United States
it&rsquo;s of course my intention that my son-in-law shall
accompany us to Europe.&nbsp; But when she calls my attention
more and more to these facts I feel that we&rsquo;re moving in a
different world.&nbsp; This is more and more the country of the
many; the few find less and less place for them; and the
individual&mdash;well, the individual has quite ceased to be
recognised.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s <a name="page491"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 491</span>recognised as a voter, but
he&rsquo;s not recognised as a gentleman&mdash;still less as a
lady.&nbsp; My daughter and I of course can only pretend to
constitute a <i>few</i>!</p>
<p>You know that I&rsquo;ve never for a moment remitted my
pretensions as an individual, though among the agitations of
pension-life I&rsquo;ve sometimes needed all my energy to uphold
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, I may be poor,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had
occasion to say, &ldquo;I may be unprotected, I may be reserved,
I may occupy a small apartment au quatri&egrave;me and be unable
to scatter unscrupulous bribes among the domestics; but at least
I&rsquo;m a <i>person</i> and have personal rights.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In this country the people have rights, but the person has
none.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have perceived that if you had come with
me to make arrangements at this establishment.&nbsp; The very
fine lady who condescends to preside over it kept me waiting
twenty minutes, and then came sailing in without a word of
apology.&nbsp; I had sat very silent, with my eyes on the clock;
Aurora amused herself with a false admiration of the room, a
wonderful drawing-room with magenta curtains, frescoed walls and
photographs of the landlady&rsquo;s friends&mdash;as if one cares
for her friends!&nbsp; When this exalted personage came in she
simply remarked that she had just been trying on a
dress&mdash;that it took so long to get a skirt to hang.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems to take very long indeed!&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;but I hope the skirt&rsquo;s right at last.&nbsp; You
might have sent for us to come up and look at it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She evidently didn&rsquo;t understand, and when I asked her to
show us her rooms she handed us over to a negro as
d&eacute;gingand&eacute; as herself.&nbsp; While we looked at
them I heard her sit down to the piano in the drawing-room; she
began to sing an air from a comic opera.&nbsp; I felt certain we
had gone quite astray; I didn&rsquo;t know in what house we could
be, and was only reassured by seeing a Bible in every room.&nbsp;
When we came down our musical hostess expressed no hope the rooms
had pleased us, she <a name="page492"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 492</span>seemed grossly indifferent to our
taking them.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t consent moreover to the
least diminution and was inflexible, as I told you, on the
article of our common beverage.&nbsp; When I pushed this point
she was so good as to observe that she didn&rsquo;t keep a
cabaret.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s not in the least considered;
there&rsquo;s no respect for one&rsquo;s privacy, for one&rsquo;s
preferences, for one&rsquo;s reserves.&nbsp; The
familiarity&rsquo;s without limits, and I&rsquo;ve already made a
dozen acquaintances, of whom I know, and wish to know,
nothing.&nbsp; Aurora tells me she&rsquo;s the &ldquo;belle of
the boarding-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appears that this is a great
distinction.</p>
<p>It brings me back to my poor child and her prospects.&nbsp;
She takes a very critical view of them herself&mdash;she tells me
I&rsquo;ve given her a false education and that no one will marry
her to-day.&nbsp; No American will marry her because she&rsquo;s
too much of a foreigner, and no foreigner will marry her because
she&rsquo;s too much of an American.&nbsp; I remind her how
scarcely a day passes that a foreigner, usually of distinction,
doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;as perversely as you will indeed&mdash;select
an American bride, and she answers me that in these cases the
young lady isn&rsquo;t married for her fine eyes.&nbsp; Not
always, I reply; and then she declares that she&rsquo;ll marry no
foreigner who shall not be one of the first of the first.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll say doubtless that she should content herself with
advantages that haven&rsquo;t been deemed insufficient for
C&eacute;cile; but I&rsquo;ll not repeat to you the remark she
made when I once employed this argument.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
doubtless be surprised to hear that I&rsquo;ve ceased to argue;
but it&rsquo;s time I should confess that I&rsquo;ve at last
agreed to let her act for herself.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s to live for
three months &agrave; l&rsquo;Am&eacute;ricaine and I&rsquo;m to
be a mere passive spectator.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll feel with me that
this is a cruel position for a c&oelig;ur de m&egrave;re.&nbsp; I
count the days till our three months are over, and I know
you&rsquo;ll join with me in my prayers.&nbsp; Aurora walks the
streets alone; <a name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
493</span>she goes out in the tramway: a voiture de place costs
five francs for the least little <i>course</i>.&nbsp; (I beseech
you not to let it be known that I&rsquo;ve sometimes had the
weakness.)&nbsp; My daughter&rsquo;s frequently accompanied by a
gentleman&mdash;by a dozen gentlemen; she remains out for hours
and her conduct excites no surprise in this establishment.&nbsp;
I know but too well the emotions it will excite in your quiet
home.&nbsp; If you betray us, ch&egrave;re Madame, we&rsquo;re
lost; and why, after all, should any one know of these things in
Geneva?&nbsp; Aurora pretends she has been able to persuade
herself that she doesn&rsquo;t care who knows them; but
there&rsquo;s a strange expression in her face which proves that
her conscience isn&rsquo;t at rest.&nbsp; I watch her, I let her
go, but I sit with my hands clasped.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
peculiar custom in this country&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t know how
to express it in Genevese: it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;being
attentive,&rdquo; and young girls are the object of the futile
process.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t necessarily anything to do with
projects of marriage&mdash;though it&rsquo;s the privilege only
of the unmarried and though at the same time (fortunately, and
this may surprise you) it has no relation to other
projects.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply an invention by which young
persons of the two sexes pass large parts of their time together
with no questions asked.&nbsp; How shall I muster courage to tell
you that Aurora now constitutes the main apparent recreation of
several gentlemen?&nbsp; Though it has no relation to marriage
the practice happily doesn&rsquo;t exclude it, and marriages have
been known to take place in consequence (or in spite) of
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that even in this country a young lady
may marry but one husband at a time, whereas she may receive at
once the attentions of several gentlemen, who are equally
entitled &ldquo;admirers.&rdquo;&nbsp; My daughter then has
admirers to an indefinite number.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll think
I&rsquo;m joking perhaps when I tell you that I&rsquo;m unable to
be exact&mdash;I who was formerly l&rsquo;exactitude
m&ecirc;me.</p>
<p><a name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>Two
of these gentlemen are to a certain extent old friends, having
been passengers on the steamer which carried us so far from
you.&nbsp; One of them, still young, is typical of the American
character, but a respectable person and a lawyer considerably
launched.&nbsp; Every one in this country follows a profession,
but it must be admitted that the professions are more highly
remunerated than chez vous.&nbsp; Mr. Cockerel, even while I
write you, is in not undisputed, but temporarily triumphant,
possession of my child.&nbsp; He called for her an hour ago in a
&ldquo;boghey&rdquo;&mdash;a strange unsafe rickety vehicle,
mounted on enormous wheels, which holds two persons very near
together; and I watched her from the window take her place at his
side.&nbsp; Then he whirled her away behind two little horses
with terribly thin legs; the whole equipage&mdash;and most of all
her being in it&mdash;was in the most questionable taste.&nbsp;
But she&rsquo;ll return&mdash;return positively very much as she
went.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same when she goes down to Mr. Louis
Leverett, who has no vehicle and who merely comes and sits with
her in the front salon.&nbsp; He has lived a great deal in Europe
and is very fond of the arts, and though I&rsquo;m not sure I
agree with him in his views of the relation of art to life and
life to art, and in his interpretation of some of the great works
that Aurora and I have studied together, he seems to me a
sufficiently serious and intelligent young man.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t regard him as intrinsically dangerous, but on the
other hand he offers absolutely no guarantees.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
no means whatever of ascertaining his pecuniary situation.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a vagueness on these points which is extremely
embarrassing, and it never occurs to young men to offer you a
reference.&nbsp; In Geneva I shouldn&rsquo;t be at a loss; I
should come to you, ch&egrave;re Madame, with my little inquiry,
and what you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell me wouldn&rsquo;t be
worth my knowing.&nbsp; But no one in New York can give me the
smallest information <a name="page495"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 495</span>about the &eacute;tat de fortune of
Mr. Louis Leverett.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that he&rsquo;s a
native of Boston, where most of his friends reside; I
can&rsquo;t, however, go to the expense of a journey to Boston
simply to learn perhaps that Mr. Leverett (the young Louis) has
an income of five thousand francs.&nbsp; As I say indeed, he
doesn&rsquo;t strike me as dangerous.&nbsp; When Aurora comes
back to me after having passed an hour with him she says he has
described to her his emotions on visiting the home of Shelley or
discussed some of the differences between the Boston temperament
and that of the Italians of the Renaissance.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
not enter into these rapprochements, and I can&rsquo;t blame
you.&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t betray me, ch&egrave;re
Madame?</p>
<h3><a name="page496"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
496</span>III<br />
FROM MISS STURDY AT NEWPORT TO MRS. DRAPER AT OUCHY</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>September</i> 1880.</p>
<p>I promised to tell you how I like it, but the truth is
I&rsquo;ve gone to and fro so often that I&rsquo;ve ceased to
like and dislike.&nbsp; Nothing strikes me as unexpected; I
expect everything in its order.&nbsp; Then too, you know,
I&rsquo;m not a critic; I&rsquo;ve no talent for keen analysis,
as the magazines say; I don&rsquo;t go into the reasons of
things.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;ve been for a longer time
than usual on the wrong side of the water, and I admit that I
feel a little out of training for American life.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re breaking me in very fast, however.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean that they bully me&mdash;I absolutely decline to
be bullied.&nbsp; I say what I think, because I believe
I&rsquo;ve on the whole the advantage of knowing what I
think&mdash;when I think anything; which is half the
battle.&nbsp; Sometimes indeed I think nothing at all.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t like that over here; they like you to have
impressions.&nbsp; That they like these impressions to be
favourable appears to me perfectly natural; I don&rsquo;t make a
crime to them of this; it seems to me on the contrary a very
amiable point.&nbsp; When individuals betray it we call them
sympathetic; I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t give
nations the same benefit.&nbsp; But there are things I
haven&rsquo;t the least desire to have an opinion about.&nbsp;
The privilege <a name="page497"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
497</span>of indifference is the dearest we possess, and I hold
that intelligent people are known by the way they exercise
it.&nbsp; Life is full of rubbish, and we have at least our share
of it over here.&nbsp; When you wake up in the morning you find
that during the night a cartload has been deposited in your front
garden.&nbsp; I decline, however, to have any of it in my
premises; there are thousands of things I want to know nothing
about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve outlived the necessity of being
hypocritical; I&rsquo;ve nothing to gain and everything to
lose.&nbsp; When one&rsquo;s fifty years old&mdash;single stout
and red in the face&mdash;one has outlived a good many
necessities.&nbsp; They tell me over here that my increase of
weight&rsquo;s extremely marked, and though they don&rsquo;t tell
me I&rsquo;m coarse I feel they think me so.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
very little coarseness here&mdash;not quite enough, I
think&mdash;though there&rsquo;s plenty of vulgarity, which is a
very different thing.&nbsp; On the whole the country becomes much
more agreeable.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that the people are
charming, for that they always were (the best of them, I
mean&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t true of the others), but that places
and things as well recognise the possibility of pleasing.&nbsp;
The houses are extremely good and look extraordinarily fresh and
clean.&nbsp; Many European interiors seem in comparison musty and
gritty.&nbsp; We have a great deal of taste; I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if we should end by inventing something pretty; we only
need a little time.&nbsp; Of course as yet it&rsquo;s all
imitation, except, by the way, these delicious piazzas.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sitting on one now; I&rsquo;m writing to you with my
portfolio on my knees.&nbsp; This broad light <i>loggia</i>
surrounds the house with a movement as free as the expanded wings
of a bird, and the wandering airs come up from the deep sea,
which murmurs on the rocks at the end of the lawn.</p>
<p>Newport&rsquo;s more charming even than you remember it; like
everything else over here it has improved.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
exquisite to-day; it&rsquo;s indeed, I think, in all <a
name="page498"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 498</span>the world
the only exquisite watering-place, for I detest the whole
genus.&nbsp; The crowd has left it now, which makes it all the
better, though plenty of talkers remain in these large light
luxurious houses which are planted with a kind of Dutch
definiteness all over the green carpet of the cliff.&nbsp; This
carpet&rsquo;s very neatly laid and wonderfully well swept, and
the sea, just at hand, is capable of prodigies of blue.&nbsp;
Here and there a pretty woman strolls over one of the lawns,
which all touch each other, you know, without hedges or fences;
the light looks intense as it plays on her brilliant dress; her
large parasol shines like a silver dome.&nbsp; The long lines of
the far shores are soft and pure, though they are places one
hasn&rsquo;t the least desire to visit.&nbsp; Altogether the
effect&rsquo;s very delicate, and anything that&rsquo;s delicate
counts immensely over here; for delicacy, I think, is as rare as
coarseness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking to you of the sea, however,
without having told you a word of my voyage.&nbsp; It was very
comfortable and amusing; I should like to take another next
month.&nbsp; You know I&rsquo;m almost offensively well at
sea&mdash;I breast the weather and brave the storm.&nbsp; We had
no storm fortunately, and I had brought with me a supply of light
literature; so I passed nine days on deck in my sea-chair with my
heels up&mdash;passed them reading Tauchnitz novels.&nbsp; There
was a great lot of people, but no one in particular save some
fifty American girls.&nbsp; You know all about the American girl,
however, having been one yourself.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re on the
whole very nice, but fifty&rsquo;s too many; there are always too
many.&nbsp; There was an inquiring Briton, a radical M.P., by
name Mr. Antrobus, who entertained me as much as any one
else.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an excellent man; I even asked him to come
down here and spend a couple of days.&nbsp; He looked rather
frightened till I told him he shouldn&rsquo;t be alone with me,
that the house was my brother&rsquo;s and that I gave the
invitation in his name.&nbsp; <a name="page499"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 499</span>He came a week ago; he goes
everywhere; we&rsquo;ve heard of him in a dozen places.&nbsp; The
English are strangely simple, or at least they seem so over
here.&nbsp; Their old measurements and comparisons desert them;
they don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s all a joke or whether
it&rsquo;s too serious by half.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re quicker than
they, though we talk so much more slowly.&nbsp; We think fast,
and yet we talk as deliberately as if we were speaking a foreign
language.&nbsp; They toss off their sentences with an air of easy
familiarity with the tongue, and yet they misunderstand
two-thirds of what people say to them.&nbsp; Perhaps after all it
is only <i>our</i> thoughts they think slowly; they think their
own often to a lively tune enough.</p>
<p>Mr. Antrobus arrived here in any case at eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning; I don&rsquo;t know how he managed it; it appears
to be his favourite hour; wherever we&rsquo;ve heard of him he
has come in with the dawn.&nbsp; In England he would arrive at
5.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; He asks innumerable
questions, but they&rsquo;re easy to answer, for he has a sweet
credulity.&nbsp; He made me rather ashamed; he&rsquo;s a better
American than so many of us; he takes us more seriously than we
take ourselves.&nbsp; He seems to think we&rsquo;ve an oligarchy
of wealth growing up which he advised me to be on my guard
against.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I can do, but I
promised him to look out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s fearfully energetic;
the energy of the people here is nothing to that of the inquiring
Briton.&nbsp; If we should devote half the zeal to building up
our institutions that they devote to obtaining information about
them we should have a very satisfactory country.&nbsp; Mr.
Antrobus seemed to think very well of us&mdash;which surprised me
on the whole, since, say what one will, it&rsquo;s far from being
so agreeable as England.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very horrid that this
should be; and it&rsquo;s delightful, when one thinks of it, that
some things in England are after all so hateful.&nbsp; <a
name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 500</span>At the same
time Mr. Antrobus appeared to be a good deal preoccupied with our
dangers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand quite what they are; they
seem to me so few on a Newport piazza this bright still
day.&nbsp; Yet alas what one sees on a Newport piazza isn&rsquo;t
America; it&rsquo;s only the back of Europe.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mean to say I haven&rsquo;t noticed any dangers since my return;
there are two or three that seem to me very serious, but they
aren&rsquo;t those Mr. Antrobus apprehends.&nbsp; One, for
instance, is that we shall cease to speak the English language,
which I prefer so to any other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less and less
spoken; American&rsquo;s crowding it out.&nbsp; All the children
speak American, which as a child&rsquo;s language is dreadfully
rough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s exclusively in use in the schools; all
the magazines and newspapers are in American.&nbsp; Of course a
people of fifty millions who have invented a new civilisation
have a right to a language of their own; that&rsquo;s what they
tell me, and I can&rsquo;t quarrel with it.&nbsp; But I wish they
had made it as pretty as the mother-tongue, from which, when
all&rsquo;s said, it&rsquo;s more or less derived.&nbsp; We ought
to have invented something as noble as our country.&nbsp; They
tell me it&rsquo;s more expressive, and yet some admirable things
have been said in the Queen&rsquo;s English.&nbsp; There can be
no question of the Queen over here of course, and American no
doubt is the music of the future.&nbsp; Poor dear future, how
&ldquo;expressive&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be!&nbsp; For women and
children, as I say, it strikes one as very rough; and, moreover,
they don&rsquo;t speak it well, their own though it be.&nbsp; My
small nephews, when I first came home, hadn&rsquo;t gone back to
school, and it distressed me to see that, though they&rsquo;re
charming children, they had the vocal inflexions of little
news-boys.&nbsp; My niece is sixteen years old; she has the
sweetest nature possible; she&rsquo;s extremely well-bred and is
dressed to perfection.&nbsp; She chatters from morning till
night; but its helplessness breaks my heart.&nbsp; These little
persons are in the <a name="page501"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
501</span>opposite case from so many English girls who know how
to speak but don&rsquo;t know how to talk.&nbsp; My niece knows
how to talk but doesn&rsquo;t know how to speak.</p>
<p>If I allude to the young people, that&rsquo;s our other
danger; the young people are eating us up&mdash;there&rsquo;s
nothing in America but the young people.&nbsp; The
country&rsquo;s made for the rising generation; life&rsquo;s
arranged for them; they&rsquo;re the destruction of
society.&nbsp; People talk of them, consider them, defer to them,
bow down to them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re always present, and
whenever they&rsquo;re present nothing else of the smallest
interest is.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re often very pretty, and
physically are wonderfully looked after; they&rsquo;re scoured
and brushed, they wear hygienic clothes, they go every week to
the dentist&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But the little boys kick your shins
and the little girls offer to slap your face.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
an immense literature entirely addressed to them in which the
kicking of shins and the slapping of faces carries the day.&nbsp;
As a woman of fifty I protest, I insist on being judged by my
peers.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too late, however, for several millions
of little feet are actively engaged in stamping out conversation,
and I don&rsquo;t see how they can long fail to keep it
under.&nbsp; The future&rsquo;s theirs; adult forms will
evidently be at an increasing discount.&nbsp; Longfellow wrote a
charming little poem called &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s
Hour,&rdquo; but he ought to have called it &ldquo;The
Children&rsquo;s Century.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by children I
naturally don&rsquo;t mean simple infants; I mean everything of
less than twenty.&nbsp; The social importance of the young
American increases steadily up to that age and then suddenly
stops.&nbsp; The little girls of course are more important than
the lads, but the lads are very important too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
struck with the way they&rsquo;re known and talked about;
they&rsquo;re small celebrities; they have reputations and
pretensions; they&rsquo;re taken very seriously.&nbsp; As for the
little girls, as I just said, they&rsquo;re ever so much too
many.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say perhaps that my fifty <a
name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 502</span>years and
my red face are jealous of them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think so,
because I don&rsquo;t suffer; my red face doesn&rsquo;t frighten
people away, and I always find plenty of talkers.&nbsp; The young
things themselves, I believe, like me very much, and I delight in
the young things.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re often very pretty; not so
pretty as people say in the magazines, but pretty enough.&nbsp;
The magazines rather overdo that; they make a mistake.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve seen no great beauties, but the level of prettiness is
high, and occasionally one sees a woman completely
handsome.&nbsp; (As a general thing, a pretty person here means a
person with a pretty face.&nbsp; The figure&rsquo;s rarely
mentioned, though there are several good ones.)&nbsp; The level
of prettiness is high, but the level of conversation is low;
that&rsquo;s one of the signs of its being a young ladies&rsquo;
country.&nbsp; There are a good many things young ladies
can&rsquo;t talk about, but think of all the things they can when
they are as clever as most of these.&nbsp; Perhaps one ought to
content one&rsquo;s self with that measure, but it&rsquo;s
difficult if one has lived long by a larger one.&nbsp; This
one&rsquo;s decidedly narrow&mdash;I stretch it sometimes till it
cracks.&nbsp; Then it is they call me coarse, which I undoubtedly
am, thank goodness.</p>
<p>What it comes to, obviously, is that people&rsquo;s talk is
much less conveniently free than in Europe; I&rsquo;m struck with
that wherever I go.&nbsp; There are certain things that are never
said at all, certain allusions that are never made.&nbsp; There
are no light stories, no propos risqu&eacute;s.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know exactly what people find to bite into, for the
supply of scandal&rsquo;s small and it&rsquo;s little more than
twaddle at that.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem, however, to lack
topics.&nbsp; The little girls are always there; they keep the
gates of conversation; very little passes that&rsquo;s not
innocent.&nbsp; I find we do very well without wickedness, and
for myself, as I take my ease, I don&rsquo;t miss my
liberties.&nbsp; You remember what I thought of the tone of your
table in Florence last year, and how <a name="page503"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 503</span>surprised you were when I asked you
why you allowed such things.&nbsp; You said they were like the
courses of the seasons; one couldn&rsquo;t prevent them; also
that to change the tone of your table you&rsquo;d have to change
so many other things.&nbsp; Of course in your house one never saw
a little girl; I was the only spinster and no one was afraid of
me.&nbsp; Likewise if talk&rsquo;s more innocent in this country
manners are so to begin with.&nbsp; The liberty of the young
people is the strongest proof of it.&nbsp; The little girls are
let loose in the world, and the world gets more good of it than
ces demoiselles get harm.&nbsp; In your world&mdash;pardon me,
but you know what I mean&mdash;this wouldn&rsquo;t do at
all.&nbsp; Your world&rsquo;s a sad affair&mdash;the young ladies
would encounter all sorts of horrors.&nbsp; Over here,
considering the way they knock about, they remain wonderfully
simple, and the reason is that society protects them instead of
setting them traps.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s almost no gallantry as
you understand it; the flirtations are child&rsquo;s play.&nbsp;
People have no time for making love; the men in particular are
extremely busy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m told that sort of thing consumes
hours; I&rsquo;ve never had any time for it myself.&nbsp; If the
leisure class should increase here considerably there may
possibly be a change; but I doubt it, for the women seem to me in
all essentials exceedingly reserved.&nbsp; Great superficial
frankness, but an extreme dread of complications.&nbsp; The men
strike me as very good fellows.&nbsp; I find them at bottom
better than the women, who if not inveterately hard haven&rsquo;t
at least the European, the (as I heard some one once call it)
chemical softness.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not so nice to the men as
the men are to them; I mean of course in proportion, you
know.&nbsp; But women aren&rsquo;t so nice as men
&ldquo;anyway,&rdquo; as they say here.</p>
<p>The men at any rate are professional, commercial; there are
very few gentlemen pure and simple.&nbsp; This personage needs to
be very well done, however, to be <a name="page504"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 504</span>of great utility; and I suppose you
won&rsquo;t pretend he&rsquo;s always well done in your
countries.&nbsp; When he&rsquo;s not, the less of him the
better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very much the same indeed with the
system on which the female young are brought up.&nbsp; (You see I
have to come back to the female young.)&nbsp; When it succeeds
they&rsquo;re the most charming creatures possible; when it
doesn&rsquo;t the failure&rsquo;s disastrous.&nbsp; If a
girl&rsquo;s a very nice girl the American method brings her to
great completeness&mdash;makes all her graces flower; but if she
isn&rsquo;t nice it plays the devil with any possible compromise
or <i>biais</i> in the interest of social convenience.&nbsp; In a
word the American girl&rsquo;s rarely negative, and when she
isn&rsquo;t a great success she&rsquo;s a great warning.&nbsp; In
nineteen cases out of twenty, among the people who know how to
live&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say what <i>their</i> proportion
is&mdash;the results are highly satisfactory.&nbsp; The girls
aren&rsquo;t shy, but I don&rsquo;t know why they should be, for
there&rsquo;s really nothing here to be afraid of.&nbsp; Manners
are very gentle, very humane; the democratic system deprives
people of weapons that every one doesn&rsquo;t equally
possess.&nbsp; No one&rsquo;s formidable; no one&rsquo;s on
stilts; no one has great pretensions or any recognised right to
be arrogant.&nbsp; I think there&rsquo;s not much wickedness, and
there&rsquo;s certainly less human or social cruelty&mdash;less
than in &ldquo;good&rdquo; (that is in more amusing)
society.&nbsp; Every one can sit&mdash;no one&rsquo;s kept
standing.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s much less liable to be snubbed, which
you will say is a pity.&nbsp; I think it is&mdash;to a certain
extent; but on the other hand folly&rsquo;s less fatuous in form
than in your countries; and as people generally have fewer
revenges to take there&rsquo;s less need of their being squashed
in advance.&nbsp; The general good nature, the social equality,
deprive them of triumphs on the one hand and of grievances on the
other.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s extremely little impertinence,
there&rsquo;s almost none.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m
describing a terrible world, a world without great <a
name="page505"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 505</span>figures or
great social prizes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve hit it, my
dear&mdash;there are no great figures.&nbsp; (The great prize of
course in Europe is the opportunity to <i>be</i> a great
figure.)&nbsp; You&rsquo;d miss these things a good
deal&mdash;you who delight to recognise greatness; and my advice
to you therefore is never to come back.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d miss
the small people even more than the great; every one&rsquo;s
middle-sized, and you can never have that momentary sense of
profiting by the elevation of your class which is so agreeable in
Europe.&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t add that you don&rsquo;t, either,
languish with its depression.&nbsp; There are at all events no
brilliant types&mdash;the most important people seem to lack
dignity.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very bourgeois; they make little
jokes; on occasion they make puns; they&rsquo;ve no form;
they&rsquo;re too good-natured.&nbsp; The men have no style; the
women, who are fidgety and talk too much, have it only in their
tournures, where they have it superabundantly.</p>
<p>Well, I console myself&mdash;since consolation is
needed&mdash;with the greater bonhomie.&nbsp; Have you ever
arrived at an English country-house in the dusk of a
winter&rsquo;s day?&nbsp; Have you ever made a call in London
when you knew nobody but the hostess?&nbsp; People here are more
expressive, more demonstrative; and it&rsquo;s a pleasure, when
one comes back&mdash;if one happens, like me, to be no one in
particular&mdash;to feel one&rsquo;s merely personal and
unclassified value rise.&nbsp; They attend to you more; they have
you on their mind; they talk to you; they listen to you.&nbsp;
That is the men do; the women listen very little&mdash;not
enough.&nbsp; They interrupt, they prattle, one feels their
presence too much as importunate and untrained sound.&nbsp; I
imagine this is partly because their wits are quick and they
think of a good many things to say; not indeed that they always
say such wonders!&nbsp; Perfect repose, after all, is not
<i>all</i> self-control; it&rsquo;s also partly stupidity.&nbsp;
American women, however, make too many <a
name="page506"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 506</span>vague
exclamations&mdash;say too many indefinite things, have in short
still a great deal of nature.&nbsp; The American order or climate
or whatever gives them a nature they <i>can</i> let loose.&nbsp;
Europe has to protect itself with more art.&nbsp; On the whole I
find very little affectation, though we shall probably have more
as we improve.&nbsp; As yet people haven&rsquo;t the assurance
that carries those things off; they know too much about each
other.&nbsp; The trouble is that over here we&rsquo;ve all been
brought up together.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll think this a picture of a
dreadfully insipid society; but I hasten to add that it&rsquo;s
not all so tame as that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been speaking of the
people that one meets socially, and these&rsquo;re the smallest
part of American life.&nbsp; The others&mdash;those one meets on
a basis of mere convenience&mdash;are much more exciting; they
keep one&rsquo;s temper in healthy exercise.&nbsp; I mean the
people in the shops and on the railroads; the servants, the
hack-men, the labourers, the conductors; every one of whom you
buy anything or have occasion to make an inquiry.&nbsp; With them
you need all your best manners, for you must always have enough
for two.&nbsp; If you think we&rsquo;re <i>too</i> democratic
taste a little of American life in these walks and you&rsquo;ll
be reassured.&nbsp; This is the region of inequality, and
you&rsquo;ll find plenty of people to make your curtsey to.&nbsp;
You see it from below&mdash;the weight of inequality&rsquo;s on
your own back.&nbsp; You asked me to tell you about prices.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re unspeakable.</p>

FROM THE RIGHT HON. EDWARD ANTROBUS, M.P., IN BOSTON TO THE
HONOURABLE MRS. ANTROBUS</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>November</i> 1880.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Susan</span>,</p>
<p>I sent you a post-card on the 13th and a native newspaper
yesterday; I really have had no time to write.&nbsp; I sent you
the newspaper partly because it contained a
report&mdash;extremely incorrect&mdash;of some remarks I made at
the meeting of the Association of the Teachers of New England;
partly because it&rsquo;s so curious that I thought it would
interest you and the children.&nbsp; I cut out some portions I
didn&rsquo;t think it well the children should go into&mdash;the
passages remaining contain the most striking features.&nbsp;
Please point out to the children the peculiar orthography, which
probably will be adopted in England by the time they are grown
up; the amusing oddities of expression and the like.&nbsp; Some
of them are intentional; you&rsquo;ll have heard of the
celebrated American humour&mdash;remind me, by the way, on my
return to Thistleton, to give you a few of the examples of it
that my own experience supplies.&nbsp; Certain other of the
journalistic eccentricities I speak of are unconscious and are
perhaps on that account the more diverting.&nbsp; Point out to
the children the difference&mdash;in so far as you&rsquo;re sure
that you yourself perceive it.&nbsp; You <a
name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 508</span>must excuse
me if these lines are not very legible; I&rsquo;m writing them by
the light of a railway lamp which rattles above my left ear; it
being only at odd moments that I can find time to extend my
personal researches.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say this is a very odd
moment indeed when I tell you I&rsquo;m in bed in a
sleeping-car.&nbsp; I occupy the upper berth (I will explain to
you the arrangement when I return) while the lower forms the
couch&mdash;the jolts are fearful&mdash;of an unknown
female.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be very anxious for my explanation,
but I assure you that the circumstance I mention is the custom of
the country.&nbsp; I myself am assured that a lady may travel in
this manner all over the Union (the Union of States) without a
loss of consideration.&nbsp; In case of her occupying the upper
berth I presume it would be different, but I must make inquiries
on this point.&nbsp; Whether it be the fact that a mysterious
being of another sex has retired to rest behind the same
curtains, or whether it be the swing of the train, which rushes
through the air with very much the same movement as the tail of a
kite, the situation is at the best so anomalous that I&rsquo;m
unable to sleep.&nbsp; A ventilator&rsquo;s open just over my
head, and a lively draught, mingled with a drizzle of cinders,
pours in through this dubious advantage.&nbsp; (I will describe
to you its mechanism on my return.)&nbsp; If I had occupied the
lower berth I should have had a whole window to myself, and by
drawing back the blind&mdash;a safe proceeding at the dead of
night&mdash;I should have been able, by the light of an
extraordinary brilliant moon, to see a little better what I
write.&nbsp; The question occurs to me, however, would the lady
below me in that case have ascended to the upper berth?&nbsp;
(You know my old taste for hypothetic questions.)&nbsp; I incline
to think (from what I have seen) that she would simply have
requested me to evacuate my own couch.&nbsp; (The ladies in this
country ask for anything they want.)&nbsp; In this case, I <a
name="page509"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 509</span>suppose, I
should have had an extensive view of the country, which, from
what I saw of it before I turned in (while the sharer of my
privacy was going to bed) offered a rather ragged expanse dotted
with little white wooden houses that resembled in the moonshine
large pasteboard boxes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been unable to ascertain
as precisely as I should wish by whom these modest residences are
occupied; for they are too small to be the homes of country
gentlemen, there&rsquo;s no peasantry here, and (in New England,
for all the corn comes from the far West) there are no yeomen nor
farmers.&nbsp; The information one receives in this country is
apt to be rather conflicting, but I&rsquo;m determined to sift
the mystery to the bottom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already noted down a multitude of facts bearing on
the points that interest me most&mdash;the operation of the
school-boards, the co-education of the sexes, the elevation of
the tone of the lower classes, the participation of the latter in
political life.&nbsp; Political life indeed is almost wholly
confined to the lower middle class and the upper section of the
lower class.&nbsp; In fact in some of the large towns the lowest
order of all participates considerably&mdash;a very interesting
phase, to which I shall give more attention.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very gratifying to see the taste for public affairs pervading so
many social strata, but the indifference of the gentry is a fact
not to be lightly considered.&nbsp; It may be objected perhaps
that there are no gentry; and it&rsquo;s very true that
I&rsquo;ve not yet encountered a character of the type of Lord
Bottomley&mdash;a type which I&rsquo;m free to confess I should
be sorry to see disappear from our English system, if system it
may be called where so much is the growth of blind and incoherent
forces.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nevertheless obvious that an idle and
luxurious class exists in this country and that it&rsquo;s less
exempt than in our own from the reproach of preferring inglorious
ease to the furtherance of liberal ideas.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
rapidly <a name="page510"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
510</span>increasing, and I&rsquo;m not sure that the indefinite
growth of the dilettante spirit, in connexion with large and
lavishly-expended wealth, is an unmixed good even in a society in
which freedom of development has obtained so many interesting
triumphs.&nbsp; The fact that this body is not represented in the
governing class is perhaps as much the result of the jealousy
with which it is viewed by the more earnest workers as of its own
(I dare not perhaps apply a harsher term than) levity.&nbsp; Such
at least is the impression made on me in the Middle States and in
New England; in the South-west, the North-west and the far West
it will doubtless be liable to correction.&nbsp; These divisions
are probably new to you; but they are the general denomination of
large and flourishing communities, with which I hope to make
myself at least superficially acquainted.&nbsp; The fatigue of
traversing, as I habitually do, three or four hundred miles at a
bound, is of course considerable; but there is usually much to
feed the mind by the way.&nbsp; The conductors of the trains,
with whom I freely converse, are often men of vigorous and
original views and even of some social eminence.&nbsp; One of
them a few days ago gave me a letter of introduction to his
brother-in-law, who&rsquo;s president of a Western
University.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t have any fear therefore that
I&rsquo;m not in the best society!</p>
<p>The arrangements for travelling are as a general thing
extremely ingenious, as you will probably have inferred from what
I told you above; but it must at the same time be conceded that
some of them are more ingenious than happy.&nbsp; Some of the
facilities with regard to luggage, the transmission of parcels
and the like are doubtless very useful when thoroughly mastered,
but I&rsquo;ve not yet succeeded in availing myself of them
without disaster.&nbsp; There are on the other hand no cabs and
no porters, and I&rsquo;ve calculated that I&rsquo;ve myself
carried my <i>impedimenta</i>&mdash;which, you know, <a
name="page511"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 511</span>are
somewhat numerous, and from which I can&rsquo;t bear to be
separated&mdash;some seventy or eighty miles.&nbsp; I have
sometimes thought it was a great mistake not to bring
Plummeridge&mdash;he would have been useful on such
occasions.&nbsp; On the other hand the startling question would
have presented itself of who would have carried
Plummeridge&rsquo;s portmanteau?&nbsp; He would have been useful
indeed for brushing and packing my clothes and getting me my tub;
I travel with a large tin one&mdash;there are none to be obtained
at the inns&mdash;and the transport of this receptacle often
presents the most insoluble difficulties.&nbsp; It is often too
an object of considerable embarrassment in arriving at private
houses, where the servants have less reserve of manner than in
England; and to tell you the truth I&rsquo;m by no means certain
at the present moment that the tub has been placed in the train
with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;On board&rdquo; the train is the
consecrated phrase here; it&rsquo;s an allusion to the tossing
and pitching of the concatenation of cars, so similar to that of
a vessel in a storm.&nbsp; As I was about to inquire, however,
Who would get Plummeridge <i>his</i> tub and attend to his little
comforts?&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t very well make our appearance,
on arriving for a visit, with <i>two</i> of the utensils
I&rsquo;ve named; even if as regards a single one I have had the
courage, as I may say, of a lifelong habit.&nbsp; It would hardly
be expected that we should both use the same; though there have
been occasions in my travels as to which I see no way of blinking
the fact that Plummeridge would have had to sit down to dinner
with me.&nbsp; Such a contingency would completely have unnerved
him, so that on the whole it was doubtless the wiser part to
leave him respectfully touching his hat on the tender in the
Mersey.&nbsp; No one touches his hat over here, and, deem this
who will the sign of a more advanced social order, I confess that
when I see poor Plummeridge again that familiar little
gesture&mdash;familiar I <a name="page512"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 512</span>mean only in the sense of
one&rsquo;s immemorial acquaintance with it&mdash;will give me a
measurable satisfaction.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see from what I tell
you that democracy is not a mere word in this country, and I
could give you many more instances of its universal reign.&nbsp;
This, however, is what we come here to look at and, in so far as
there appears proper occasion, to admire; though I&rsquo;m by no
means sure that we can hope to establish within an appreciable
time a corresponding change in the somewhat rigid fabric of
English manners.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not even inclined to believe
such a change desirable; you know this is one of the points on
which I don&rsquo;t as yet see my way to going so far as Lord
B.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always held that there&rsquo;s a certain
social ideal of inequality as well as of equality, and if
I&rsquo;ve found the people of this country, as a general thing,
quite equal to each other, I&rsquo;m not quite ready to go so far
as to say that, as a whole, they&rsquo;re equal to&mdash;pardon
that dreadful blot!&nbsp; The movement of the train and the
precarious nature of the light&mdash;it is close to my nose and
most offensive&mdash;would, I flatter myself, long since have got
the better of a less resolute diarist!</p>
<p>What I was distinctly <i>not</i> prepared for is the very
considerable body of aristocratic feeling that lurks beneath this
republican simplicity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve on several occasions been
made the confidant of these romantic but delusive vagaries, of
which the stronghold appears to be the Empire City&mdash;a slang
name for the rich and predominant, but unprecedentedly
maladministered and disillusioned New York.&nbsp; I was assured
in many quarters that this great desperate eternally-swindled
city at least is ripe, everything else failing, for the
monarchical experiment or revolution, and that if one of the
Queen&rsquo;s sons would come over to sound the possibilities he
would meet with the highest encouragement.&nbsp; This information
was given me in <a name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
513</span>strict confidence, with closed doors, as it were; it
reminded me a good deal of the dreams of the old Jacobites when
they whispered their messages to the king across the water.&nbsp;
I doubt, however, whether these less excusable visionaries will
be able to secure the services of a Pretender, for I fear that in
such a case he would encounter a still more fatal Culloden.&nbsp;
I have given a good deal of time, as I told you, to the
educational system, and have visited no fewer than one hundred
and forty-three schools and colleges.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
extraordinary the number of persons who are being educated in
this country; and yet at the same time the tone of the people is
less scholarly than one might expect.&nbsp; A lady a few days
since described to me her daughter as being always &ldquo;on the
go,&rdquo; which I take to be a jocular way of saying that the
young lady was very fond of paying visits.&nbsp; Another person,
the wife of a United States Senator, informed me that if I should
go to Washington in January I should be quite &ldquo;in the
swim.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t regard myself as slow to grasp
new meanings, however whimsical; but in this case the
lady&rsquo;s explanation made her phrase rather more than less
ambiguous.&nbsp; To say that I&rsquo;m on the go describes very
accurately my own situation.&nbsp; I went yesterday to the
Poganuc High School, to hear fifty-seven boys and girls recite in
unison a most remarkable ode to the American flag, and shortly
afterward attended a ladies&rsquo; luncheon at which some eighty
or ninety of the sex were present.&nbsp; There was only one
individual in trousers&mdash;his trousers, by the way, though he
brought several pair, begin to testify to the fury of his
movements!&nbsp; The men in America absent themselves
systematically from this meal, at which ladies assemble in large
numbers to discuss religious, political and social topics.</p>
<p>Immense female symposia at which every delicacy is provided
are one of the most striking features of <a
name="page514"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 514</span>American
life, and would seem to prove that our sex is scarcely so
indispensable in the scheme of creation as it sometimes
supposes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been admitted on the footing of an
Englishman&mdash;&ldquo;just to show you some of our bright
women,&rdquo; the hostess yesterday remarked.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Bright&rdquo; here has the meaning of <i>intellectually
remarkable</i>.)&nbsp; I noted indeed the frequency of the
predominantly cerebral&mdash;as they call it here
&ldquo;brainy&rdquo;&mdash;type.&nbsp; These rather oddly
invidious banquets are organised according to age, for I&rsquo;ve
also been present as an inquiring stranger at several
&ldquo;girls&rsquo; lunches,&rdquo; from which married ladies are
rigidly excluded, but here the fair revellers were equally
numerous and equally &ldquo;bright.&rdquo;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
good deal I should like to tell you about my study of the
educational question, but my position&rsquo;s now somewhat
cramped, and I must dismiss the subject briefly.&nbsp; My leading
impression is that the children are better educated (in
proportion of course) than the adults.&nbsp; The position of a
child is on the whole one of great distinction.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a popular ballad of which the refrain, if I&rsquo;m
not mistaken, is &ldquo;Make me a child again just for
to-night!&rdquo; and which seems to express the sentiment of
regret for lost privileges.&nbsp; At all events they are a
powerful and independent class, and have organs, of immense
circulation, in the press.&nbsp; They are often extremely
&ldquo;bright.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve talked with a great many
teachers, most of them lady-teachers, as they are here
called.&nbsp; The phrase doesn&rsquo;t mean teachers of ladies,
as you might suppose, but applies to the sex of the instructress,
who often has large classes of young men under her control.&nbsp;
I was lately introduced to a young woman of twenty-three who
occupies the chair of Moral Philosophy and Belles-Lettres in a
Western University and who told me with the utmost frankness that
she&rsquo;s &ldquo;just adored&rdquo; by the
undergraduates.&nbsp; This young woman was the daughter of a
petty trader in one of the <a name="page515"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 515</span>South-western States and had studied
at Amanda College in Missourah, an institution at which young
people of the two sexes pursue their education together.&nbsp;
She was very pretty and modest, and expressed a great desire to
see something of English country life, in consequence of which I
made her promise to come down to Thistleton in the event of her
crossing the Atlantic.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not the least like
Gwendolen or Charlotte, and I&rsquo;m not prepared to say how
they would get on with her; the boys would probably do
better.&nbsp; Still, I think her acquaintance would be of value
to dear Miss Gulp, and the two might pass their time very
pleasantly in the school-room.&nbsp; I grant you freely that
those I have seen here are much less comfortable than the
school-room at Thistleton.&nbsp; Has Charlotte, by the way,
designed any more texts for the walls?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
extremely interested in my visit to Philadelphia, where I saw
several thousand little red houses with white steps, occupied by
intelligent artisans and arranged (in streets) on the rectangular
system.&nbsp; Improved cooking-stoves, rosewood pianos, gas and
hot water, esthetic furniture and complete sets of the British
Essayists.&nbsp; A tramway through every street; every block of
exactly equal length; blocks and houses economically lettered and
numbered.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s absolutely no loss of time and no
need of looking for, or indeed <i>at</i>, anything.&nbsp; The
mind always on one&rsquo;s object; it&rsquo;s very
delightful.</p>

FROM LOUIS LEVERETT IN BOSTON TO HARVARD TREMONT IN PARIS</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>November</i> 1880.</p>
<p>The scales have turned, my sympathetic Harvard, and the beam
that has lifted you up has dropped me again on this terribly hard
spot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m extremely sorry to have missed you in
London, but I received your little note and took due heed of your
injunction to let you know how I got on.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t get
on at all, my dear Harvard&mdash;I&rsquo;m consumed with the love
of the further shore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been so long away that
I&rsquo;ve dropped out of my place in this little Boston world
and the shallow tides of New England life have closed over
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a stranger here and find it hard to believe I
ever was a native.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very hard, very cold, very
vacant.&nbsp; I think of your warm rich Paris; I think of the
Boulevard Saint-Michel on the mild spring evenings; I see the
little corner by the window (of the Caf&eacute; de la Jeunesse)
where I used to sit: the doors are open, the soft deep breath of
the great city comes in.&nbsp; The sense is of a supreme
splendour and an incomparable arrangement, yet there&rsquo;s a
kind of tone, of body, in the radiance; the mighty murmur of the
ripest civilisation in the world comes in; the dear old <i>peuple
de Paris</i>, the most interesting people in the world, pass
by.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a little book in my pocket; it&rsquo;s
exquisitely printed, a <a name="page517"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 517</span>modern Elzevir.&nbsp; It consists of
a lyric cry from the heart of young France and is full of the
sentiment of form.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no form here, dear
Harvard; I had no idea how little form there is.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what I shall do; I feel so undraped, so
uncurtained, so uncushioned; I feel as if I were sitting in the
centre of a mighty &ldquo;reflector.&rdquo;&nbsp; A terrible
crude glare is over everything; the earth looks peeled and
excoriated; the raw heavens seem to bleed with the quick hard
light.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not got back my rooms in West Cedar Street;
they&rsquo;re occupied by a mesmeric healer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
staying at an hotel and it&rsquo;s all very dreadful.&nbsp;
Nothing for one&rsquo;s self, nothing for one&rsquo;s preferences
and habits.&nbsp; No one to receive you when you arrive; you push
in through a crowd, you edge up to a counter, you write your name
in a horrible book where every one may come and stare at it and
finger it.&nbsp; A man behind the counter stares at you in
silence; his stare seems to say &ldquo;What the devil do
<i>you</i> want?&rdquo;&nbsp; But after this stare he never looks
at you again.&nbsp; He tosses down a key at you; he presses a
bell; a savage Irishman arrives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take him
away,&rdquo; he seems to say to the Irishman; but it&rsquo;s all
done in silence; there&rsquo;s no answer to your own wild
wail&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done with me,
please?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait and you&rsquo;ll see&rdquo; the
awful silence seems to say.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a great crowd
round you, but there&rsquo;s also a great stillness; every now
and then you hear some one expectorate.&nbsp; There are a
thousand people in this huge and hideous structure; they feed
together in a big white-walled room.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s lighted by
a thousand gas-jets and heated by cast-iron screens which vomit
forth torrents of scorching air.&nbsp; The temperature&rsquo;s
terrible; the atmosphere&rsquo;s more so; the furious light and
heat seem to intensify the dreadful definiteness.&nbsp; When
things are so ugly they shouldn&rsquo;t be so definite, and
they&rsquo;re terribly ugly here.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no mystery
in the <a name="page518"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
518</span>corners, there&rsquo;s no light and shade in the
types.&nbsp; The people are haggard and joyless; they look as if
they had no passions, no tastes, no senses.&nbsp; They sit
feeding in silence under the dry hard light; occasionally I hear
the high firm note of a child.&nbsp; The servants are black and
familiar; their faces shine as they shuffle about; there are blue
tones in their dark masks.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve no manners; they
address but don&rsquo;t answer you; they plant themselves at your
elbow (it rubs their clothes as you eat) and watch you as if your
proceedings were strange.&nbsp; They deluge you with iced water;
it&rsquo;s the only thing they&rsquo;ll bring you; if you look
round to summon them they&rsquo;ve gone for more.&nbsp; If you
read the newspaper&mdash;which I don&rsquo;t, gracious heaven, I
can&rsquo;t!&mdash;they hang over your shoulder and peruse it
also.&nbsp; I always fold it up and present it to them; the
newspapers here are indeed for an African taste.</p>
<p>Then there are long corridors defended by gusts of hot air;
down the middle swoops a pale little girl on parlour
skates.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get out of my way!&rdquo; she shrieks as she
passes; she has ribbons in her hair and frills on her dress; she
makes the tour of the immense hotel.&nbsp; I think of Puck, who
put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes, and wonder what
<i>he</i> said as he flitted by.&nbsp; A black waiter marches
past me bearing a tray that he thrusts into my spine as he
goes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s laden with large white jugs; they tinkle
as he moves, and I recognise the unconsoling fluid.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re dying of iced water, of hot air, of flaring
gas.&nbsp; I sit in my room thinking of these things&mdash;this
room of mine which is a chamber of pain.&nbsp; The walls are
white and bare, they shine in the rays of a horrible chandelier
of imitation bronze which depends from the middle of the
ceiling.&nbsp; It flings a patch of shadow on a small table
covered with white marble, of which the genial surface supports
at the present moment the sheet of paper I thus employ for you;
and when I go to bed (I like to read in <a
name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 519</span>bed,
Harvard) it becomes an object of mockery and torment.&nbsp; It
dangles at inaccessible heights; it stares me in the face; it
flings the light on the covers of my book but not upon the
page&mdash;the little French Elzevir I love so well.&nbsp; I rise
and put out the gas&mdash;when my room becomes even lighter than
before.&nbsp; Then a crude illumination from the hall, from the
neighbouring room, pours through the glass openings that surmount
the two doors of my apartment.&nbsp; It covers my bed, where I
toss and groan; it beats in through my closed lids; it&rsquo;s
accompanied by the most vulgar, though the most human,
sounds.&nbsp; I spring up to call for some help, some remedy; but
there&rsquo;s no bell and I feel desolate and weak.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s only a strange orifice in the wall, through which
the traveller in distress may transmit his appeal.&nbsp; I fill
it with incoherent sounds, and sounds more incoherent yet come
back to me.&nbsp; I gather at last their meaning; they appear to
constitute an awful inquiry.&nbsp; A hollow impersonal voice
wishes to know what I want, and the very question paralyses
me.&nbsp; I want everything&mdash;yet I want nothing, nothing
this hard impersonality can give!&nbsp; I want my little corner
of Paris; I want the rich, the deep, the dark Old World; I want
to be out of this horrible place.&nbsp; Yet I can&rsquo;t confide
all this to that mechanical tube; it would be of no use; a
barbarous laugh would come up from the office.&nbsp; Fancy
appealing in these sacred, these intimate moments to an
&ldquo;office&rdquo;; fancy calling out into indifferent space
for a candle, for a curtain!&nbsp; I pay incalculable sums in
this dreadful house, and yet haven&rsquo;t a creature to assist
me.&nbsp; I fling myself back on my couch and for a long time
afterwards the orifice in the wall emits strange murmurs and
rumblings.&nbsp; It seems unsatisfied and indignant and is
evidently scolding me for my vagueness.&nbsp; My vagueness
indeed, dear Harvard!&nbsp; I loathe their horrible
arrangements&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that definite enough?</p>
<p><a name="page520"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 520</span>You
asked me to tell you whom I see and what I think of my
friends.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t very many; I don&rsquo;t feel at
all <i>en rapport</i>.&nbsp; The people are very good, very
serious, very devoted to their work; but there&rsquo;s a terrible
absence of variety of type.&nbsp; Every one&rsquo;s Mr. Jones,
Mr. Brown, and every one looks like Mr. Jones and Mr.
Brown.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re thin, they&rsquo;re diluted in the
great tepid bath of Democracy!&nbsp; They lack completeness of
identity; they&rsquo;re quite without modelling.&nbsp; No,
they&rsquo;re not beautiful, my poor Harvard; it must be
whispered that they&rsquo;re not beautiful.&nbsp; You may say
that they&rsquo;re as beautiful as the French, as the Germans;
but I can&rsquo;t agree with you there.&nbsp; The French, the
Germans, have the greatest beauty of all, the beauty of their
ugliness&mdash;the beauty of the strange, the grotesque.&nbsp;
These people are not even ugly&mdash;they&rsquo;re only
plain.&nbsp; Many of the girls are pretty, but to be only pretty
is (to my sense) to be plain.&nbsp; Yet I&rsquo;ve had some
talk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a young woman.&nbsp; She was on the
steamer, and I afterwards saw her in New York&mdash;a mere maiden
thing, yet a peculiar type, a real personality: a great deal of
modelling, a great deal of colour, and withal something elusive
and ambiguous.&nbsp; She was not, however, of this country; she
was a compound of far-off things.&nbsp; But she was looking for
something here&mdash;like me.&nbsp; We found each other, and for
a moment that was enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost her now;
I&rsquo;m sorry, because she liked to listen to me.&nbsp; She has
passed away; I shall not see her again.&nbsp; She liked to listen
to me; she almost understood.</p>

FROM M. GUSTAVE LEJAUNE OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN WASHINGTON TO M.
ADOLPHE BOUCHE IN PARIS</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>December</i> 1880.</p>
<p>I give you my little notes; you must make allowances for
haste, for bad inns, for the perpetual scramble, for
ill-humour.&nbsp; Everywhere the same impression&mdash;the
platitude of unbalanced democracy intensified by the platitude of
the spirit of commerce.&nbsp; Everything on an immense
scale&mdash;everything illustrated by millions of examples.&nbsp;
My brother-in-law is always busy; he has appointments,
inspections, interviews, disputes.&nbsp; The people, it appears,
are incredibly sharp in conversation, in argument; they wait for
you in silence at the corner of the road and then suddenly
discharge their revolver.&nbsp; If you fall they empty your
pockets; the only chance is to shoot them first.&nbsp; With this
no amenities, no preliminaries, no manners, no care for the
appearance.&nbsp; I wander about while my brother&rsquo;s
occupied; I lounge along the streets; I stop at the corners; I
look into the shops; <i>je regarde passer les femmes</i>.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s an easy country to see; one sees everything there is;
the civilisation&rsquo;s skin deep; you don&rsquo;t have to
dig.&nbsp; This positive practical pushing bourgeoisie is always
about its business; it lives in the street, in the hotel, in <a
name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 522</span>the train;
one&rsquo;s always in a crowd&mdash;there are seventy-five people
in the tramway.&nbsp; They sit in your lap; they stand on your
toes; when they wish to pass they simply push you.&nbsp;
Everything in silence; they know that silence is golden and
they&rsquo;ve the worship of gold.&nbsp; When the conductor
wishes your fare he gives you a poke, very serious, without a
word.&nbsp; As for the types&mdash;but there&rsquo;s only one,
they&rsquo;re all variations of the same&mdash;the
commis-voyageur <i>minus</i> the gaiety.&nbsp; The women are
often pretty; you meet the young ones in the streets, in the
trains, in search of a husband.&nbsp; They look at you frankly,
coldly, judicially, to see if you&rsquo;ll serve; but they
don&rsquo;t want what you might think (<i>du moines on me
l&rsquo;assure</i>); they only want the husband.&nbsp; A
Frenchman may mistake; he needs to be sure he&rsquo;s right, and
I always make sure.&nbsp; They begin at fifteen; the mother sends
them out; it lasts all day (with an interval for dinner at a
pastry-cook&rsquo;s); sometimes it goes on for ten years.&nbsp;
If they haven&rsquo;t by that time found him they give it up;
they make place for the <i>cadettes</i>, as the number of women
is enormous.&nbsp; No salons, no society, no conversation; people
don&rsquo;t receive at home; the young girls have to look for the
husband where they can.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no disgrace not to find
him&mdash;several have never done so.&nbsp; They continue to go
about unmarried&mdash;from the force of habit, from the love of
movement, without hopes, without regrets.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
imagination, no sensibility, no desire for the convent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made several journeys&mdash;few of less than three
hundred miles.&nbsp; Enormous trains, enormous <i>wagons</i>,
with beds and lavatories, with negroes who brush you with a big
broom, as if they were grooming a horse.&nbsp; A bounding
movement, a roaring noise, a crowd of people who look horribly
tired, a boy who passes up and down hurling pamphlets and
sweetmeats into your face: that&rsquo;s an American
journey.&nbsp; <a name="page523"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
523</span>There are windows in the <i>wagons</i>&mdash;enormous
like everything else; but there&rsquo;s nothing to see.&nbsp; The
country&rsquo;s a void&mdash;no features, no objects, no details,
nothing to show you that you&rsquo;re in one place more than
another.&nbsp; <i>Aussi</i> you&rsquo;re not in one place,
you&rsquo;re everywhere, anywhere; the train goes a hundred miles
an hour.&nbsp; The cities are all the same; little houses ten
feet high or else big ones two hundred; tramways,
telegraph-poles, enormous signs, holes in the pavement, oceans of
mud, commis-voyageurs, young ladies looking for the
husband.&nbsp; On the other hand no beggars and no
<i>cocottes</i>&mdash;none at least that you see.&nbsp; A
colossal mediocrity, except (my brother-in-law tells me) in the
machinery, which is magnificent.&nbsp; Naturally no architecture
(they make houses of wood and of iron), no art, no literature, no
theatre.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve opened some of the books&mdash;<i>ils
ne se laissent pas lire</i>.&nbsp; No form, no matter, no style,
no general ideas: they seem written for children and young
ladies.&nbsp; The most successful (those that they praise most)
are the facetious; they sell in thousands of editions.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve looked into some of the most <i>vant&eacute;s</i>; but
you need to be forewarned to know they&rsquo;re amusing; grins
through a horse-collar, burlesques of the Bible, <i>des
plaisanteries de croquemort</i>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve a novelist
with pretensions to literature who writes about the chase for the
husband and the adventures of the rich Americans in our corrupt
old Europe, where their primeval candour puts the Europeans to
shame.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est proprement &eacute;crit</i>, but
it&rsquo;s terribly pale.&nbsp; What isn&rsquo;t pale is the
newspapers&mdash;enormous, like everything else (fifty columns of
advertisements), and full of the <i>comm&eacute;rages</i> of a
continent.&nbsp; And such a tone, <i>grand Dieu</i>!&nbsp; The
amenities, the personalities, the recriminations, are like so
many <i>coups de revolver</i>.&nbsp; Headings six inches tall;
correspondences from places one never heard of; telegrams from
Europe about Sarah Bernhardt; little paragraphs <a
name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 524</span>about
nothing at all&mdash;the <i>menu</i> of the neighbour&rsquo;s
dinner; articles on the European situation <i>&agrave; pouffer de
rire</i>; all the <i>tripotage</i> of local politics.&nbsp; The
<i>reportage</i> is incredible; I&rsquo;m chased up and down by
the interviewers.&nbsp; The matrimonial infelicities of M. and
Madame X. (they give the name) <i>tout au long</i>, with every
detail&mdash;not in six lines, discreetly veiled, with an art of
insinuation, as with us; but with all the facts (or the
fictions), the letters, the dates, the places, the hours.&nbsp; I
open a paper at hazard and find <i>au beau milieu</i>, apropos of
nothing, the announcement: &ldquo;Miss Susan Green has the
longest nose in Western New York.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Susan Green
(<i>je me renseigne</i>) is a celebrated authoress, and the
Americans have the reputation of spoiling their women.&nbsp; They
spoil them <i>&agrave; coups de poing</i>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen few interiors (no one speaks French); but if
the newspapers give an idea of the domestic <i>m&oelig;urs</i>,
the <i>m&oelig;urs</i> must be curious.&nbsp; The
passport&rsquo;s abolished, but they&rsquo;ve printed my
<i>signalement</i> in these sheets&mdash;perhaps for the young
ladies who look for the husband.&nbsp; We went one night to the
theatre; the piece was French (they are the only ones) but the
acting American&mdash;too American; we came out in the
middle.&nbsp; The want of taste is incredible.&nbsp; An
Englishman whom I met tells me that even the language corrupts
itself from day to day; the Englishman ceases to
understand.&nbsp; It encourages me to find I&rsquo;m not the only
one.&nbsp; There are things every day that one can&rsquo;t
describe.&nbsp; Such is Washington, where we arrived this
morning, coming from Philadelphia.&nbsp; My brother-in-law wishes
to see the Bureau of Patents, and on our arrival he went to look
at his machines while I walked about the streets and visited the
Capitol!&nbsp; The human machine is what interests me most.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t even care for the political&mdash;for that&rsquo;s
what they call their Government here, &ldquo;the
machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It operates very roughly, and <a
name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 525</span>some day
evidently will explode.&nbsp; It is true that you&rsquo;d never
suspect they <i>have</i> a government; this is the principal
seat, but, save for three or four big buildings, most of them
<i>affreux</i>, it looks like a settlement of negroes.&nbsp; No
movement, no officials, no authority, no embodiment of the
State.&nbsp; Enormous streets, <i>comme toujours</i>, lined with
little red houses where nothing ever passes but the
tramway.&nbsp; The Capitol&mdash;a vast structure, false classic,
white marble, iron and stucco, which has <i>assez grand
air</i>&mdash;must be seen to be appreciated.&nbsp; The goddess
of liberty on the top, dressed in a bear&rsquo;s skin; their
liberty over here is the liberty of bears.&nbsp; You go into the
Capitol as you would into a railway station; you walk about as
you would in the Palais Royal.&nbsp; No functionaries, no
door-keepers, no officers, no uniforms, no badges, no
reservations, no authority&mdash;nothing but a crowd of shabby
people circulating in a labyrinth of spittoons.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
too much governed perhaps in France; but at least we have a
certain incarnation of the national conscience, of the national
dignity.&nbsp; The dignity&rsquo;s absent here, and I&rsquo;m
told the public conscience is an abyss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;&eacute;tat c&rsquo;est moi</i>&rdquo;
even&mdash;I like that better than the spittoons.&nbsp; These
implements are architectural, monumental; they&rsquo;re the only
monuments.&nbsp; <i>En somme</i> the country&rsquo;s interesting,
now that we too have the Republic; it is the biggest
illustration, the biggest warning.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the last word
of democracy, and that word is&mdash;platitude.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very big, very rich, and perfectly ugly.&nbsp; A Frenchman
couldn&rsquo;t live here; for life with us, after all, at the
worst, is a sort of appreciation.&nbsp; Here one has nothing to
appreciate.&nbsp; As for the people, they&rsquo;re the English
<i>minus</i> the conventions.&nbsp; You can fancy what
remains.&nbsp; The women, <i>pourtant</i>, are sometimes rather
well turned.&nbsp; There was one at Philadelphia&mdash;I made her
acquaintance by accident&mdash;whom it&rsquo;s probable I shall
see again.&nbsp; <a name="page526"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
526</span>She&rsquo;s not looking for the husband; she has
already got one.&nbsp; It was at the hotel; I think the husband
doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; A Frenchman, as I&rsquo;ve said, may
mistake, and he needs to be sure he&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;
<i>Aussi</i> I always make sure!</p>

FROM MARCELLUS COCKEREL IN WASHINGTON TO MRS. COOLER, N&Eacute;E
COCKEREL, AT OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 1880.</p>
<p>I ought to have written you long before this, for I&rsquo;ve
had your last excellent letter these four months in my
hands.&nbsp; The first half of that time I was still in Europe,
the last I&rsquo;ve spent on my native soil.&nbsp; I think
accordingly my silence is owing to the fact that over there I was
too miserable to write and that here I&rsquo;ve been too
happy.&nbsp; I got back the 1st of September&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
have seen it in the papers.&nbsp; Delightful country where one
sees everything in the papers&mdash;the big familiar vulgar
good-natured delightful papers, none of which has any reputation
to keep up for anything but getting the news!&nbsp; I really
think that has had as much to do as anything else with my
satisfaction at getting home&mdash;the difference in what they
call the &ldquo;tone of the press.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Europe
it&rsquo;s too dreary&mdash;the sapience, the solemnity, the
false respectability, the verbosity, the long disquisitions on
superannuated subjects.&nbsp; Here the newspapers are like the
railroad-trains which carry everything that comes to the station
and have only the religion of punctuality.&nbsp; As a woman,
however, you probably detest them; you think they&rsquo;re (the
great word) vulgar.&nbsp; I admitted it just now, and I&rsquo;m
very happy to have an early opportunity <a
name="page528"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 528</span>to announce
to you that that idea has quite ceased to have any terrors for
me.&nbsp; There are some conceptions to which the female mind can
never rise.&nbsp; Vulgarity&rsquo;s a stupid superficial
question-begging accusation, which has become to-day the easiest
refuge of mediocrity.&nbsp; Better than anything else it saves
people the trouble of thinking, and anything which does that
succeeds.&nbsp; You must know that in these last three years in
Europe I&rsquo;ve become terribly vulgar myself; that&rsquo;s one
service my travels have rendered me.&nbsp; By three years in
Europe I mean three years in foreign parts altogether, for I
spent several months of that time in Japan, India and the rest of
the East.&nbsp; Do you remember when you bade me good-bye in San
Francisco the night before I embarked for Yokohama?&nbsp; You
foretold that I&rsquo;d take such a fancy to foreign life that
America would never see me more, and that if you should wish to
see me (an event you were good enough to regard as possible)
you&rsquo;d have to make a rendezvous in Paris or in Rome.&nbsp;
I think we made one&mdash;which you never kept; but I shall never
make another for those cities.&nbsp; It was in Paris, however,
that I got your letter; I remember the moment as well as if it
were (to my honour) much more recent.&nbsp; You must know that
among many places I dislike Paris carries the palm.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m bored to death there; it&rsquo;s the home of every
humbug.&nbsp; The life is full of that false comfort which is
worse than discomfort, and the small fat irritable people give me
the shivers.</p>
<p>I had been making these reflexions even more devoutly than
usual one very tiresome evening toward the beginning of last
summer when, as I re-entered my hotel at ten o&rsquo;clock, the
little reptile of a portress handed me your gracious lines.&nbsp;
I was in a villainous humour.&nbsp; I had been having an
overdressed dinner in a stuffy restaurant and had gone from there
to a suffocating theatre, where, by way of amusement, I saw <a
name="page529"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 529</span>a play in
which blood and lies were the least of the horrors.&nbsp; The
theatres over there are insupportable; the atmosphere&rsquo;s
pestilential.&nbsp; People sit with their elbows in your sides;
they squeeze past you every half hour.&nbsp; It was one of my bad
moments&mdash;I have a great many in Europe.&nbsp; The
conventional mechanical play, all in falsetto, which I seemed to
have seen a thousand times; the horrible faces of the people, the
pushing bullying <i>ouvreuse</i> with her false politeness and
her real rapacity, drove me out of the place at the end of an
hour; and as it was too early to go home, I sat down before a
caf&eacute; on the Boulevard, where they served me a glass of
sour watery beer.&nbsp; There on the Boulevard, in the summer
night, life itself was even uglier than the play, and it
wouldn&rsquo;t do for me to tell you what I saw.&nbsp; Besides, I
was sick of the Boulevard, with its eternal grimace and the
deadly sameness of the <i>article de Paris</i>, which pretends to
be so various&mdash;the shop-windows a wilderness of rubbish and
the passers-by a procession of manikins.&nbsp; Suddenly it came
over me that I was supposed to be amusing myself&mdash;my face
was a yard long&mdash;and that you probably at that moment were
saying to your husband: &ldquo;He stays away so long!&nbsp; What
a good time he must be having!&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea was the
first thing that had made me smile for a month; I got up and
walked home, reflecting as I went that I was &ldquo;seeing
Europe&rdquo; and that after all one <i>must</i> see
Europe.&nbsp; It was because I had been convinced of this that I
had come out, and it&rsquo;s because the operation has been
brought to a close that I&rsquo;ve been so happy for the last
eight weeks.&nbsp; I was very conscientious about it, and, though
your letter that night made me abominably homesick, I held out to
the end, knowing it to be once for all.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t
trouble Europe again; I shall see America for the rest of my
days.&nbsp; My long delay has had the advantage that now at least
I can give you my impressions&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean <a
name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 530</span>of Europe;
impressions of Europe are easy to get&mdash;but of this country
as it strikes the reinstated exile.&nbsp; Very likely
you&rsquo;ll think them queer; but keep my letter and twenty
years hence they&rsquo;ll be quite commonplace.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t even be vulgar.&nbsp; It was very deliberate, my
going round the world.&nbsp; I knew that one ought to see for
one&rsquo;s self and that I should have eternity, so to speak, to
rest.&nbsp; I travelled energetically; I went everywhere and saw
everything; took as many letters as possible and made as many
acquaintances.&nbsp; In short I held my nose to the grindstone
and here I am back.</p>
<p>Well, the upshot of it all is that I&rsquo;ve got rid of a
superstition.&nbsp; We have so many that one the
less&mdash;perhaps the biggest of all&mdash;makes a real
difference in one&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; The one in
question&mdash;of course you have it&mdash;is that there&rsquo;s
no salvation but through Europe.&nbsp; Our salvation is here, if
we have eyes to see it, and the salvation of Europe into the
bargain; that is if Europe&rsquo;s to be saved, which I rather
doubt.&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;ll call me a bird of freedom, a
vulgar patriot, a waver of the stars and stripes; but I&rsquo;m
in the delightful position of not minding in the least what any
one calls me.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t a mission; I don&rsquo;t want
to preach; I&rsquo;ve simply arrived at a state of mind.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got Europe off my back.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no idea how
it simplifies things and how jolly it makes me feel.&nbsp; Now I
can live, now I can talk.&nbsp; If we wretched Americans could
only say once for all &ldquo;Oh Europe be hanged!&rdquo; we
should attend much better to our proper business.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve simply to mind that business and the rest will look
after itself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll probably inquire what it is I
like better over here, and I&rsquo;ll answer that it&rsquo;s
simply&mdash;life.&nbsp; Disagreeables for disagreeables I prefer
our own.&nbsp; The way I&rsquo;ve been bored and bullied in
foreign parts, and the way I&rsquo;ve had to say I found it
pleasant!&nbsp; For a good while this appeared to be a sort of <a
name="page531"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 531</span>congenital
obligation, but one fine day it occurred to me that there was no
obligation at all and that it would ease me immensely to admit to
myself that (for me at least) all those things had no
importance.&nbsp; I mean the things they rub into you over there;
the tiresome international topics, the petty politics, the stupid
social customs, the baby-house scenery.&nbsp; The vastness and
freshness of this American world, the great scale and great pace
of our development, the good sense and good nature of the people,
console me for there being no cathedrals and no Titians.&nbsp; I
hear nothing about Prince Bismarck and Gambetta, about the
Emperor William and the Czar of Russia, about Lord Beaconsfield
and the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; I used to get so tired of their
Mumbo-Jumbo of a Bismarck, of his secrets and surprises, his
mysterious intentions and oracular words.&nbsp; They revile us
for our party politics; but what are all the European jealousies
and rivalries, their armaments and their wars, their rapacities
and their mutual lies, but the intensity of the spirit of
party?&nbsp; What question, what interest, what idea, what need
of mankind, is involved in any of these things?&nbsp; Their big
pompous armies drawn up in great silly rows, their gold lace,
their salaams, their hierarchies, seem a pastime for children:
there&rsquo;s a sense of humour and of reality over here that
laughs at all that.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re nearer the reality, nearer what they&rsquo;ll
all have to come to.&nbsp; The questions of the future are social
questions, which the Bismarcks and Beaconsfields are very much
afraid to see settled; and the sight of a row of supercilious
potentates holding their peoples like their personal property and
bristling all over, to make a mutual impression, with feathers
and sabres, strikes us as a mixture of the grotesque and the
abominable.&nbsp; What do we care for the mutual impressions of
potentates who amuse themselves with sitting on people?&nbsp;
Those things are their own affair, and they ought to be <a
name="page532"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 532</span>shut up in
a dark room to have it out together.&nbsp; Once one feels, over
here, that the great questions of the future are social
questions, that a mighty tide is sweeping the world to democracy,
and that this country is the biggest stage on which the drama can
be enacted, the fashionable European topics seem petty and
parochial.&nbsp; They talk about things that we&rsquo;ve settled
ages ago, and the solemnity with which they propound to you their
little domestic embarrassments makes a heavy draft on one&rsquo;s
good nature.&nbsp; In England they were talking about the Hares
and Rabbits Bill, about the extension of the County Franchise,
about the Dissenters&rsquo; Burials, about the Deceased
Wife&rsquo;s Sister, about the abolition of the House of Lords,
about heaven knows what ridiculous little measure for the
propping-up of their ridiculous little country.&nbsp; And they
call <i>us</i> provincial!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to sit and look
respectable while people discuss the utility of the House of
Lords and the beauty of a State Church, and it&rsquo;s only in a
dowdy musty civilisation that you&rsquo;ll find them doing such
things.&nbsp; The lightness and clearness of the social
air&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> the great relief in these
parts.&nbsp; The gentility of bishops, the propriety of parsons,
even the impressiveness of a restored cathedral, give less of a
charm to life than that.&nbsp; I used to be furious with the
bishops and beadles, with the humbuggery of the whole affair,
which every one was conscious of but which people agreed not to
expose because they&rsquo;d be compromised all round.&nbsp; The
convenience of life in our conditions, the quick and simple
arrangements, the absence of the spirit of routine, are a blessed
change from the stupid stiffness with which I struggled for two
long years.&nbsp; There were people with swords and cockades who
used to order me about; for the simplest operation of life I had
to kootoo to some bloated official.&nbsp; When it was a question
of my doing a little differently from others the bloated official
<a name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 533</span>gasped
as if I had given him a blow on the stomach; he needed to take a
week to think of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand it&rsquo;s impossible to take an American by
surprise; he&rsquo;s ashamed to confess he hasn&rsquo;t the wit
to do a thing another man has had the wit to think of.&nbsp;
Besides being as good as his neighbour he must therefore be as
clever&mdash;which is an affliction only to people who are afraid
he may be cleverer.&nbsp; If this general efficiency and
spontaneity of the people&mdash;the union of the sense of freedom
with the love of knowledge&mdash;isn&rsquo;t the very essence of
a high civilisation I don&rsquo;t know what a high civilisation
is.&nbsp; I felt this greater ease on my first railroad
journey&mdash;felt the blessing of sitting in a train where I
could move about, where I could stretch my legs and come and go,
where I had a seat and a window to myself, where there were
chairs and tables and food and drink.&nbsp; The villainous little
boxes on the European trains, in which you&rsquo;re stuck down in
a corner with doubled-up knees, opposite to a row of people,
often most offensive types, who stare at you for ten hours on
end&mdash;these were part of my two years&rsquo; ordeal.&nbsp;
The large free way of doing things here is everywhere a
pleasure.&nbsp; In London, at my hotel, they used to come to me
on Saturday to make me order my Sunday&rsquo;s dinner, and when I
asked for a sheet of paper they put it into the bill.&nbsp; The
meagreness, the stinginess, the perpetual expectation of a
sixpence, used to exasperate me.&nbsp; Of course I saw a great
many people who were pleasant; but as I&rsquo;m writing to you
and not to one of them I may say that they were dreadfully apt to
be dull.&nbsp; The imagination among the people I see here is
more flexible, and then they have the advantage of a larger
horizon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not bounded on the north by the British
aristocracy and on the south by the <i>scrutin de
liste</i>.&nbsp; (I mix up the countries a little, but
they&rsquo;re not worth the keeping apart.)&nbsp; The absence of
little conventional <a name="page534"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 534</span>measurements, of little
cut-and-dried judgements, is an immense refreshment.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re more analytic, more discriminating, more familiar
with realities.&nbsp; As for manners, there are bad manners
everywhere, but an aristocracy is bad manners organised.&nbsp; (I
don&rsquo;t mean that they mayn&rsquo;t be polite among
themselves, but they&rsquo;re rude to every one else.)&nbsp; The
sight of all these growing millions simply minding their business
is impressive to me&mdash;more so than all the gilt buttons and
padded chests of the Old World; and there&rsquo;s a certain
powerful type of &ldquo;practical&rdquo; American (you&rsquo;ll
find him chiefly in the West) who doesn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;blow&rdquo; as I do (I&rsquo;m not practical) but who
quietly feels that he has the Future in his vitals&mdash;a type
that strikes me more than any I met in your favourite
countries.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;ll come back to the cathedrals and
Titians, but there&rsquo;s a thought that helps one to do without
them&mdash;the thought that, though we&rsquo;ve an immense deal
of pie-eating plainness, we&rsquo;ve little misery, little
squalor, little degradation.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no regular
wife-beating class, and there are none of the stultified peasants
of whom it takes so many to make a European noble.&nbsp; The
people here are more conscious of things; they invent, they act,
they answer for themselves; they&rsquo;re not (I speak of social
matters) tied up by authority and precedent.&nbsp; We shall have
all the Titians by and by, and we shall move over a few
cathedrals.&nbsp; You had better stay here if you want to have
the best.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;m a roaring Yankee; but
you&rsquo;ll call me that if I say the least, so I may as well
take my ease and say the most.&nbsp; Washington&rsquo;s a most
entertaining place; and here at least, at the seat of government,
one isn&rsquo;t overgoverned.&nbsp; In fact there&rsquo;s no
government at all to speak of; it seems too good to be
true.&nbsp; The first day I was here I went to the Capitol, and
it took me ever so long to figure to myself that I had as good a
right there as any one else&mdash;that the <a
name="page535"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 535</span>whole
magnificent pile (it <i>is</i> magnificent, by the way) was in
fact my own.&nbsp; In Europe one doesn&rsquo;t rise to such
conceptions, and my spirit had been broken in Europe.&nbsp; The
doors were gaping wide&mdash;I walked all about; there were no
door-keepers, no officers nor flunkeys, there wasn&rsquo;t even a
policeman to be seen.&nbsp; It seemed strange not to see a
uniform, if only as a patch of colour.&nbsp; But this isn&rsquo;t
government by livery.&nbsp; The absence of these things is odd at
first; you seem to miss something, to fancy the machine has
stopped.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t, though; it only works without
fire and smoke.&nbsp; At the end of three days this simple
negative impression, the fact that there are no soldiers nor
spies, nothing but plain black coats, begins to affect the
imagination, becomes vivid, majestic, symbolic.&nbsp; It ends by
being more impressive than the biggest review I saw in
Germany.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;m a roaring Yankee; but one has
to take a big brush to copy a big model.&nbsp; The future&rsquo;s
here of course, but it isn&rsquo;t only that&mdash;the
present&rsquo;s here as well.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll complain that I
don&rsquo;t give you any personal news, but I&rsquo;m more modest
for myself than for my country.&nbsp; I spent a month in New York
and while there saw a good deal of a rather interesting girl who
came over with me in the steamer and whom for a day or two I
thought I should like to marry.&nbsp; But I
shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She has been spoiled by Europe&mdash;and
yet the prime stuff struck me as so right.</p>
<h3><a name="page536"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
536</span>VIII<br />
FROM MISS AURORA CHURCH IN NEW YORK TO MISS WHITESIDE IN
PARIS</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>January</i> 1881.</p>
<p>I told you (after we landed) about my agreement with
mamma&mdash;that I was to have my liberty for three months and
that if at the end of this time I shouldn&rsquo;t have made a
good use of it I was to give it back to her.&nbsp; Well, the
time&rsquo;s up to-day, and I&rsquo;m very much afraid I
haven&rsquo;t made a good use of it.&nbsp; In fact I
haven&rsquo;t made any use of it at all&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got
married, for that&rsquo;s what mamma meant by our little
bargain.&nbsp; She has been trying to marry me in Europe for
years, without a <i>dot</i>, and as she has never (to the best of
my knowledge) even come near it, she thought at last that if she
were to leave it to me I might possibly do better.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t certainly do worse.&nbsp; Well, my dear,
I&rsquo;ve done very badly&mdash;that is I haven&rsquo;t done at
all.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t even tried.&nbsp; I had an idea that
the <i>coup</i> in question came of itself over here; but it
hasn&rsquo;t come to <i>me</i>.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
disappointed, for I haven&rsquo;t on the whole seen any one I
should like to marry.&nbsp; When you marry people in these parts
they expect you to love them, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any one I
should like to love.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is,
but they&rsquo;re none of them what I&rsquo;ve thought of.&nbsp;
It may be that I&rsquo;ve thought of the impossible; and yet
I&rsquo;ve seen people in Europe whom I should have liked to
marry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true they were almost always married to
some one else.&nbsp; What I <i>am</i> disappointed in is simply
<a name="page537"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 537</span>having
to give back my liberty.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish particularly to
be married, and I do wish to do as I like&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve
been doing for the last month.&nbsp; All the same I&rsquo;m sorry
for poor mamma, since nothing has happened that she wished to
happen.&nbsp; To begin with, we&rsquo;re not appreciated, not
even by the Rucks, who have disappeared in the strange way in
which people over here seem to vanish from the world.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve made no sensation; my new dresses count for nothing
(they all have better ones); our philological and historical
studies don&rsquo;t show.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been told we might do
better in Boston; but on the other hand mamma hears that in
Boston the people only marry their cousins.&nbsp; Then
mamma&rsquo;s out of sorts because the country&rsquo;s
exceedingly dear and we&rsquo;ve spent all our money.&nbsp;
Moreover, I&rsquo;ve neither eloped, nor been insulted, nor been
talked about, nor&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;deteriorated in
manners or character; so that she&rsquo;s wrong in all her
previsions.&nbsp; I think she would have rather liked me to be
insulted.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve been insulted as little as
I&rsquo;ve been adored.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t adore you over
here; they only make you think they&rsquo;re going to.</p>
<p>Do you remember the two gentlemen who were on the ship, and
who, after we arrived, came to see me <i>&agrave; tour de
r&ocirc;le</i>?&nbsp; At first I never dreamed they were making
love to me, though mamma was sure it must be that; then, as it
went on a good while, I thought perhaps it <i>was</i>
that&mdash;after which I ended by seeing it wasn&rsquo;t
anything!&nbsp; It was simply conversation&mdash;and conversation
a precocious child might have listened to at that.&nbsp; Mr.
Leverett and Mr. Cockerel disappeared one fine day without the
smallest pretension to having broken my heart, I&rsquo;m
sure&mdash;though it only depended on me to think they must have
tried to.&nbsp; All the gentlemen are like that; you can&rsquo;t
tell what they mean; the &ldquo;passions&rdquo; don&rsquo;t rage,
the appearances <a name="page538"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
538</span>don&rsquo;t matter&mdash;nobody believes them.&nbsp;
Society seems oddly to consist of a sort of innocent
jilting.&nbsp; I think on the whole I <i>am</i> a little
disappointed&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean about one&rsquo;s not
marrying; I mean about the life generally.&nbsp; It looks so
different at first that you expect it will be very exciting; and
then you find that after all, when you&rsquo;ve walked out for a
week or two by yourself and driven out with a gentleman in a
buggy, that&rsquo;s about all there is to it, as they say
here.&nbsp; Mamma&rsquo;s very angry at not finding more to
dislike; she admitted yesterday that, once one has got a little
settled, the country hasn&rsquo;t even the merit of being
hateful.&nbsp; This has evidently something to do with her
suddenly proposing three days ago that we should &ldquo;go
West.&rdquo;&nbsp; Imagine my surprise at such an idea coming
from mamma!&nbsp; The people in the pension&mdash;who, as usual,
wish immensely to get rid of her&mdash;have talked to her about
the West, and she has taken it up with a kind of
desperation.&nbsp; You see we must do something; we can&rsquo;t
simply remain here.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re rapidly being ruined and
we&rsquo;re not&mdash;so to speak&mdash;getting married.&nbsp;
Perhaps it will be easier in the West; at any rate it will be
cheaper and the country will have the advantage of being more
hateful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a question between that and returning
to Europe, and for the moment mamma&rsquo;s balancing.&nbsp; I
say nothing: I&rsquo;m really indifferent; perhaps I shall marry
a pioneer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just thinking how I shall give back my
liberty.&nbsp; It really won&rsquo;t be possible; I haven&rsquo;t
got it any more; I&rsquo;ve given it away to others.&nbsp; Mamma
may get it back if she can from <i>them</i>!&nbsp; She comes in
at this moment to announce that we must push further&mdash;she
has decided for the West.&nbsp; Wonderful mamma!&nbsp; It appears
that my real chance is for a pioneer&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
sometimes millions.&nbsp; But fancy us at Oshkosh!</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
